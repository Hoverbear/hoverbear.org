            <meta name="twitter:description" content="Over the last couple days at asquera we&#x27;ve been on a retreat at the Landhaus Fredenwalde. It&#x27;s really beautiful out here and it&#x27;s given me a chance to work on a few small projects which I&#x27;ve been wanting to explore for awhile now.
Anyways, yesterday I set up a system that uses Ansible, Let&#x27;s Encrypt, nginx, and DigitalOcean to terminate HTTP and proxy requests to arbitrary hosts. The intended use case for this is to have Github Pages sites able to be dropped onto a custom domain that is SSL enabled, but there are many other use cases which I haven&#x27;t experimented with (yet).
I was, primarily, interested in exploring using Ansible and DigitalOcean. It worked out quite well http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoverbear.org&#x2F; is running on it at the moment!

    <p>Over the last couple days at <a href="http://asquera.de/">asquera</a> we've been on a retreat at the <a href="http://landhaus-fredenwalde.de/">Landhaus Fredenwalde</a>. It's really beautiful out here and it's given me a chance to work on a few small projects which I've been wanting to explore for awhile now.</p>
<p>Anyways, yesterday I set up a system that uses <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>, <a href="http://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>, <a href="https://hoverbear.org/blog/an-https-terminator-box/nginx.com">nginx</a>, and <a href="http://digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> to terminate HTTP and proxy requests to arbitrary hosts. The intended use case for this is to have <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> sites able to be dropped onto a custom domain that is SSL enabled, but there are many other use cases which I haven't experimented with (yet).</p>
<p>I was, primarily, interested in exploring using Ansible and DigitalOcean. It worked out quite well <a href="http://hoverbear.org/">http://hoverbear.org/</a> is running on it at the moment!</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Without further ado, you can check out the repository <a href="https://github.com/Hoverbear/https-terminator#https-terminator">here</a>. Trying it out on a test subdomain should be quite cheap (in the order of a few cents) and it's rather interesting to poke at.</p>
<h2 id="on-ansible">On Ansible</h2>
<p>I've had some experience with <a href="https://puppet.com/">Puppet</a>, <a href="https://www.chef.io/">Chef</a>, and <a href="http://terraform.io/">Terraform</a> in different capacities however I had only ever played with Ansible in a minimal fashion. In particular I'd only used Ansible as part of some course work on the <a href="http://gee-project.org/">GENI Experiment Engine</a> which gives you slices of machines distributed around North America. I liked my experience and after a recent talk at the <a href="http://berlinops.de/">Berlin DevOps summit</a> I was inspired to try it more.</p>
<p>So what's the differentiator between it and the others? Well the big differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is agent-less. Only Python and SSH are required. Puppet and Chef both require agents.</li>
<li>It's declarative, so there's no complex scripts happening. Chef is scriptable in Ruby, Puppet is also declarative.</li>
<li>It's just YAML, not some custom syntax. Puppet uses it's own special syntax.</li>
<li>It has a broad scope, doing things from creating cloud VMs to copying files. Terraform is limited to infrastructure, Puppet and Chef don't do infrastructure as part of their standard package.</li>
<li>It isn't particularly opinionated about file structure. Chef and Puppet are a bit picky about how you organize things.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's basically it! Puppet, Chef, and Ansible all <em>essentially</em> address the same problems in different fashions and they all do so in a perfectly acceptable manner. I think it's pretty much down to personal opinion and experience.</p>
<p>As for me, I'll be using Ansible on my next few projects to learn more about it. I think I prefer it.</p>

Hello,

My name is Ana Hobden, or Hoverbear / 飘飘熊 / Schwebebär. I speak primarily English, but I also know a bit of Deutsch and 汉语. I am a forward-looking human who is passionate about open source, community, technology, education, and space. I am a Canadian from the west coast, and have ancestry from Norway, France, England, and the Listuguj Mi'kmaq. Ultimately though, I am from Earth, just like you.

I live in Victoria, Canada. It's a provincial capital with around 92,000 residents. I grew up here and love the diverse population, green spaces, sustainable living, and cultural attitudes. It's also conviently located close to Vancouver and Seattle, with easy flights to most of the world from their airports. For a couple years I also lived in Berlin, and it remains my favorite city to experience humanity.

Life draws me into many interesting adventures and teachings. I try to use this site to catalog and document some of it. While it documents edited and often well researched topics, it does not capture the true *texture* of life. When I write I try to take you along on my exploration, but that is by no means a subsitute for your own adventures.

Friendships are something I am constantly looking to build, if you need someone to talk to, or some help with a problem, let me know. I'd love to try to help. Alternatively, if you're giving your life some texture and wholeness, I'd love to talk and learn about your perspective.

Humanity is a beautiful patchwork. I will not view you worse because of your ethnicity, sexuality, gender, physique, or anything else. I will respect your wishes around pronouns, and I do not mind whatever you use for me. The only reason I will treat you differently is if I see you disrespecting or harming others. We're all in this together, we've all suffered enough.

I am involved in [RustCon Asia](http://rustcon.asia/), [RustFest](http://rustfest.eu/), [Rust Belt Rust](http://rust-belt-rust.com/), [Rust](http://rust-lang.org/), and [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) currently. Conferences have kind of become a way of life for me and I love travelling around the world to visit them. If you're interested in having me offer a workshop or talk at a conference you are most encouraged to get in touch. I prefer smaller, interactive sessions.

Professionally, you can find me usually on a laptop working from home or abroadW, reaching out to small clusters of etheral resources, attaching their ethernets, adjusting their knobs and levers, and helping them cooperate on monumental tasks. Recent employers include [PingCAP](http://pingcap.com/) (building [TiKV](http://tikv.org/)), [Asquera](http://asquera.de/) (helping clients with their systems), [Science Venture](http://www.scienceventure.ca/) (teaching and doing community outreach), the predecessor of the [Health Data Coalition](http://hdcbc.ca/), the [BCAAFC](http://bcaafc.com/) (serving indigenous communities), and the [(Mod)ularity Squad](https://yvonnecoady.com/) Distributed Systems lab.

I hold a Bachelor in Computer Science, and a Networking Option (with Distinction) from the [University of Victoria](http://uvic.ca/). But that is not a measure of my ability or skill. It is simply a font of knowledge for me to share. University taught me many things, but my own studies and work experience were often more valuable.

On a personal side, I have an adorable Golden Retriever named Nami who lives with my long term partner and I. We like to spend our weekends and holidays camping, hiking, or even just wandering the city. During the weekdays we try to fit in hikes and rock combing where possible. If you'd like some of the best camping I've ever found you can explore Port Renfrew. I'm also an avid fan of video games involving strategy, puzzle, or finesse. Favorites include Northgard, Titanfall 2, and No Man's Sky. I've also recently developed an interest in modelling, which I think is a healthy hobby.

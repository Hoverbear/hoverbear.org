Hello,

My name is Andrew Hobden. I'm a forward-looking human who is passionate about open-source, technology, education, and space.

Currently I am an undergraduate student at the University of Victoria studying Computer Science with a Networking focus. I'm involved with the (Mod)ularity Squad lead by Dr. Yvonne Coady and have been previously affiliated with Simbioses Lab lead by Dr. Jens Weber and Dr. Morgan Price.

My research interests are distributed systems, networking, infrastructure, and automation. I am a morally aligned being and seek projects that help, not hurt, people. If you are interested in working with me on any of my research or projects please, just go ahead!

I also work under contract with the B.C. Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres doing special projects and conference organization. I am part Aboriginal myself and hail from the Listuguj Mi'kmaq.

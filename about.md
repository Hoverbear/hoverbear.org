Hello,

My name is Andrew Hobden. I speak primarily English, but I also know a bit of Deutsch and 汉语. I am a forward-looking human who is passionate about open source, community, technology, education, and space. I am a Canadian from the west coast, and have ancestry from Norway, France, England, and the Listuguj Mi'kmaq. Ultimately though, I am from Earth, just like you.

Life draws me into many interesting adventures and teachings. I try to use this site to catalog and document some of it. While it documents edited and often well researched topics, it does not capture the true *texture* of life. When I write I try to take you along on my exploration, but that is by no means a subsitute for your own adventures.

Friendships are something I am constantly looking to build, if you need someone to talk to, or some help with a problem, let me know. I'd love to try to help. Alternatively, if you're giving your life some texture and wholeness, I'd love to talk and learn about your perspective.

Humanity is a beautiful patchwork. I will not view you worse because of your ethnicity, sexuality, physique, or anything else. I will respect your wishes around pronouns, and I do not mind whatever you use for me. I will treat you differently if I see you disrespecting others. We're all in this together, we've all suffered enough.

I am involved in [RustFest](http://rustfest.eu/), [Rust Belt Rust](http://rust-belt-rust.com/), [Rust](http://rust-lang.org/), and [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) currently. Conferences have kind of become a way of life for me and I love travelling around the world to visit them. If you're interested in having me offer a workshop or talk at a conference you are most encouraged to get in touch. I prefer smaller, interactive sessions.

Professionally, you can find me usually on a laptop, reaching out to small clusters of etheral resources, attaching their ethernets, adjusting their knobs and levers, and helping them cooperate on monumental tasks. Recent employers include [PingCAP](http://pingcap.com/) (building distributed databases), [Asquera](http://asquera.de/) (helping clients with their systems), [Science Venture](http://www.scienceventure.ca/) (teaching and doing community outreach), the predecessor of the [Health Data Coalition](http://hdcbc.ca/), the [BCAAFC](http://bcaafc.com/) (serving indigenous communities), and the [(Mod)ularity Squad](https://yvonnecoady.com/) Distributed Systems lab.

I hold a Bachelor in Computer Science, and a Networking Option (with Distinction) from the [University of Victoria](http://uvic.ca/). But that is not a measure of my ability or skill. It is simply a font of knowledge for me to share. University taught me many things, but my own studies and work experience were often more valuable.

Hello,

My name is Andrew Hobden. I'm a forward-looking human who is passionate about open-source, technology, education, and space. I hail from Western Canada with ancestry from Norway, France, England, and the Listuguj Mi'kmaq.

Recently I completed a Computer Science degree at the University of Victoria with a Networking focus. I focused primarily on distributed systems, networking, and systems code. During my time at the university I also got to explore fun topics like Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Music Information Retrieval (MIR), and Computation Physics which broadened my horizons.

I'm still loosely involved with the [(Mod)ularity Squad](http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~ycoady/), a distributed systems lab lead by Dr. Yvonne Coady. My research interests are distributed systems, networking, infrastructure, and automation. I am a morally aligned being and seek projects that help, not hurt, people.

Community and education is immensely important to me. For several years I've worked with the [B.C. Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres](http://bcaafc.com/) doing special projects and conference organization. During my time at the university I worked with [Science Venture](http://scienceventure.ca/) to expand their programming and outreach activities.

> Most people imagine that resolving particular problems will make them happy. If only one had more money, or love, or success, then life would feel manageable. It can be devastating to realize the falseness of such tempered optimism. A great hope gets crushed every time someone reminds us that happiness can be neither assumed nor earned; that we are all prisoners of our own flawed brains; that the ultimate aloneness in each of us is, finally, inviolable. - [Andrew Soloman](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/suicide-crime-loneliness)

Mr. Soloman's quote really resonated with me, particularly in the context of the article it was about. My interpretation and thoughts about it are wholly private though.

> Arguing with an Engineer is a lot like wrestling in the mud with a pig: After a few hours, you realize the pig likes it. - Unknown

The more I time I spend in engineering, the more I like the mud myself. It's important to make sure that the other person enjoys the mud as well though.

> “Our freedom is built on what others do not know of our existences”  - Russian novelist Alexander Solzhenitysn

I found this quote particularly relevant in the case of the Canadian Bill C-51 which destroys our privacy.

> "A group of crows is called a murder. A group of people on the internet should be called an argument." - Unknown

Without fail, someone will always be an asshole.

This is the fifth part of an ongoing series on configuring a new server. In our [last post](/2016/05/09/new-roots-4/) we discussed and configured some basic tools. For all intensive purposes, our 'root' system is complete. What we'll be doing now is building containers to host various services.

Before we get around to setting things up, let's describe the what we're up to.

Currently, the only external service the server is running is `ssh`. We'd like our server to host more services. These services are likely to be both internal services like databases, and external services like HTTP/HTTPS hosts. Since the IPv4 space is increasingly crowded we'd like to do all of these things from one IPv4 address too.

There are lots of ways to provide isolation to these services. These include virtual machines through something like [Xen](http://xenproject.org/), containers through something like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), or even just chroots. Isolation isn't just for security, it's one way to help increase your security *somewhat* but it isn't a silver bullet. Light solutions like containers have very little overhead though so the benefits tend to outweigh the costs.

We'll use containers, because they're entertaining and fun to use. This is a laboratory, remember? We're suposed to have fun and play with new things.

## An Introduction to Containers

We'll be using `machinectl` to work with our containers. You may already know Docker, CoreOS's `rkt`, or `lxc`, and you're more than welcome to use any of those. The important thing is to only use **one** on this machine. You don't want to be managing multiple container providers. Good news is they're all pretty much compatible with one another, so if you use `machinectl` you can still use Docker images.

To get started with our first container, we first need to construct one. We'll make a scratch directory and put it in there. We'll tell `pacstrap`, which came as part of `arch-install-scripts`, to ignore anything that's likely unnecessary in a container.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/scratch/
echo -e "n\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\n\n" | sudo pacstrap -i -c -d ~/scratch/ base --ignore linux,linux-firmware,cryptsetup,jfsutils,lvm2,nano,netctl,reiserfsprogs,vi,xfsprogs,mdadm,device-mapper,licenses,man-pages,pcmciautils
```

This should give you an installed package size of under 400MB. That's pretty decent. We could probably go smaller but it doesn't really matter. We don't need to worry about setting up things like `iptables` since it's already protected via the host, and we don't need to have things like `vi` because we'll do our editing from outside of the container. We don't need things like `linux` because we're using the host kernel.

Take a look in `~/scratch` and you should see what appears to be a base Arch install like we had before. You could totally use `arch-chroot` on it and use it as a sandbox just like that. Instead, we're going to import it into `machinectl`.

```bash
cd ~/scratch
sudo tar --create --preserve-permissions --gzip * | sudo machinectl import-tar --read-only - base
```

After a second, this command will be done and we'll have our first image. `machinectl list-images` shows this:

```
NAME TYPE      RO  USAGE  CREATED                     MODIFIED
base subvolume yes 277.6M Wed 2016-05-11 15:52:43 PDT n/a     

1 images listed.
```

We can test out the image with `machinectl start base`. If you get an "Operation not supported" error here it's because you updated your kernel and haven't restarted. In the future we'll talk about [`kexec`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/kexec) to help with this problem.

You can get a shell into the container with `machinectl shell base`. You'll probably notice there is no network connection, but you can see that there is a `host0` adapter in `ip addr`.

This can be fixed by starting `systemd-networkd` and `systemd-resolved`. Checking `ip addr` again you'll notice `host0` now has an IP. However running `ping hoverbear.org` or `ping 8.8.8.8` reveals that that our firewall is blocking us. You can check this by observing `iptables -nvL` and watching the packet counts go up on the `icmp-port-unreachable` filter.

Editing our `/etc/iptables/iptables.rules` we can add a line:

```diff
 # Accept anything from the local loopback.
 --append INPUT --in-interface lo --jump ACCEPT
+# Accept anything originating from a container.
+--append INPUT --in-interface ve-+ --jump ACCEPT
+--append FORWARD --in-interface ve-+ --jump ACCEPT
+--append FORWARD --out-interface ve-+ --jump ACCEPT
```

This rule will make it so any communications coming from our container adapters will be permitted accepted. Now reload the firewall with `systemctl restart iptables`.

Returning to your container with `machinectl reboot base` then `machinectl shell base` you can start `systemd-networkd` and `systemd-resolved` again. At this point you should have networking!

## The Web Proxy

Since we know we'd like to host be able to host multiple web services we'll need to set up a *proxy* to handle port 80, the default socket for `httpd`. Since only one program can bind to a given port at a time, its job will be to inspect the incoming traffic to observe the *Server Name Indentification*, or *SNI*, then route it to the appropriate container. By default this will be the `web-$VARIABLE` container, where the request is `$VARIABLE.$DOMAIN.$TLD`. We'll call it `web`.

```
[network: example.hoverbear.org]->[web]->[web-example]
```

Later we'll follow a similar scheme for `db`, `user`, `sandbox`, `cache`, etc. You can use whichever scheme you'd like, or change later, just **be consistent**.

This is the third in a series of posts about getting settled into a server. First we talked about [choosing a server](/2016/05/06/new-roots-1/), then we talked about [installing a base OS on a dedicated server](/2016/05/06/new-roots-2/). In this post we'll discuss configuring, securing, and hardening our server.

In our last post we left our new server in a very, very minimal state. Heck, we didn't even tell it it's own name! In this post we'll talk about configuration. Throughout this process we're going to try to keep things simple and tightly knit.

I'm purposely choosing some things I'm not familiar with to learn as I go, so please feel free to offer any advice you might have.

## Hostname

We can set the hostname with the following command:

```bash
HOSTNAME=silicon
hostnamectl set-hostname $HOSTNAME
```

This writes the hostname to `/etc/hostname`. After you'll want to look in `/etc/hosts`. Here's what mine ended up like after I was done editing it. I'm setting up a host called `silicon` on the `hoverbear.org` domain.


```
#
# /etc/hosts: static lookup table for host names
#

#<ip>	    <hostname.domain.org>	<hostname>
127.0.0.1       silicon.hoverbear.org   silicon
138.201.63.106  silicon.hoverbear.org   silicon
::1             silicon.hoverbear.org   silicon
```

You can test that the local name is working with `ping $HOSTNAME`.

Now that our server thinks it's `$HOSTNAME` we need to tell everything else in the world that it is! If you happen to have a domain name, you should go to your provider's DNS console and route `$HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN.$TLD` to your device's IP address. You can find this with `ip addr`.

For me that looked like adding a line to a table with the following information:

```
silicon     138.201.63.106      A (Address)
```

Go make yourself a tea, then try pinging your server from a different machine a few minutes later.

```bash
FQDN=silicon.hoverbear.org
ping $FQDN
```

Once it starts working you're all set with your domain name! Do note it can take up to 24 hours for global DNS propagation.

## Time

One choice which may bring up confusion is the timezone to set your server to. If you're only going to be hosting services in one time zone you may wish to simply set it to that. If you provide services internationally the question becomes more unclear. One option is UTC.

One thing to consider while evaluating your options on time is to consider how you'll be hosting your services. Later we'll talk about using containers to host your services, and these can all operate on their own timezones. You can review timezones available with `timedatectl list-timezones`.

Properly designed programs will store timezones as part of their dates, but not all programs are properly designed. Changing your timezone later can temporarily cause rather strange issues, so be forwarned.

I'm going to just choose my current local time for now. Since my root host won't be running any time sensitive services I can change it without worrying too much.

```bash
timedatectl set-timezone Canada/Pacific
```

Since we're running a server that will, ultimately, be responsible for possibly time-sensitive data it might be a good idea to ensure we have accurate times. In order to do this we'll enable an `ntp` service.

```bash
timedatectl set-ntp true
```

## A Simple Firewall

Most modern kernels come built in with `iptables` and `nftables` support already. In Arch, `iptables` is pulled in as part of base. `nftables` is a newer 'spiritual successor' to `iptables` however there is little practical real world documentation. Since some of the things we'll be doing later on will be utilizing `iptables` it's probably a good idea to use that.

There is a [menagerie](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Firewalls#iptables) of different frontends for `iptables` that put a layer between you and it. However `iptables` isn't that difficult to understand and has some great [documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Iptables). Learning how to understand what's happening in `iptables` will make using even frontends easier later on, if you even choose to use them.

We'll be referencing the [Simple Stateful Firewall](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Simple_stateful_firewall) for our initial setup.

Since we're currently on a remote device over SSH we need to be careful not to lock ourselves out. So let's set some basic filter settings in `/etc/iptables/iptables.rules`:

```bash
*filter
### Defaults for the chain.
# Drop anything that we don't catch from input.
:INPUT DROP [0:0]

# We're not a router, we shouldn't forward anything along a NAT.
:FORWARD DROP [0:0]

# We trust things running on this machine, so accept them all.
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]

# User defined chains.
:TCP - [0:0]
:UDP - [0:0]

# Accept already established or related connections.
--append INPUT --match conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED --jump ACCEPT

# Accept anything from the local loopback.
--append INPUT --in-interface lo --jump ACCEPT

# Drop any invalid packets. We can't reject since there's no valid way to reject.
--append INPUT --match conntrack --ctstate INVALID --jump DROP

# Accept any pings.
--append INPUT --protocol icmp --match icmp --icmp-type 8 --match conntrack --ctstate NEW --jump ACCEPT

# Attach the user defined chains (UDP, TCP) to valid connections on the
# respective protocol. Recall that anything established is already accepted.
--append INPUT --protocol udp --match conntrack --ctstate NEW --jump UDP
--append INPUT --protocol tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN --match conntrack --ctstate NEW --jump TCP

# Reject TCP connections with TCP RESET packets and UDP streams with ICMP port
# unreachable messages if the ports are not opened.
--append INPUT --protocol udp --jump REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
--append INPUT --protocol tcp --jump REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset

# Reject all remaining incoming traffic with icmp protocol unreachable messages.
--append INPUT --jump REJECT --reject-with icmp-proto-unreachable

### TCP Chain
# Allow SSH connections.
--append TCP --protocol tcp --dport 22 --jump ACCEPT

COMMIT
```

Now you can start and get the status of the `iptables` service.

```bash
systemctl start iptables
systemctl status iptables
```

Now try ending your `ssh` session and hopping back in. If it didn't work you can just reset the machine and try reconfiguring. If it did work then we can enable the service on boot.

```bash
systemctl enable iptables
```

At this point you can review your current settings and see various usages with `iptables -nvL`:

```
Chain INPUT (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

    1   439 REJECT     udp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
    2    80 REJECT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            reject-with tcp-reset

Chain FORWARD (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 146 packets, 20108 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         

Chain TCP (1 references)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         
    2   108 ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            tcp dpt:22

Chain UDP (1 references)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination
```

As you can see from the `pkts` column, our rule in `TCP` got used for an `ssh` connection, and the rule for already established connections is also being used.

## Hardening

Servers get attacked, it's a fact of life. Let's take some simple steps to help build up a bit of security for ourselves. First let's set some flags in `/etc/sysctl.d/50-hardening.conf`:

```bash
# Only root can see dmesg
kernel.dmesg_restrict = 1
# Restrict kernel pointer access.
kernel.kptr_restrict = 1

# TCP SYN cookie protection (default) helps protect against SYN flood attacks
# only kicks in when net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog is reached
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

# Protect against tcp time-wait assassination hazards drop RST packets for
# sockets in the time-wait state (not widely supported outside of linux,
# but conforms to RFC)
net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337 = 1

# Sets the kernels reverse path filtering mechanism to value 1, it will do
# source validation of the packet's recieved from all the interfaces on the
# machine protects from attackers that are using ip spoofing methods to do harm
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv6.conf.all.rp_filter = 1

# Log any martian packets, those destined for reserved addresses illegally.
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1

# Ignore echo broadcast requests to prevent being part of smurf attacks
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

# Ignore bogus icmp errors
net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1

# Don't send redirects
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0

# Only secure ICMP routing redirects
net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects=0
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0

net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0

# Protect against some hardlink and symlink vulnerabilities.
fs.protected_hardlinks = 1
fs.protected_symlinks = 1
```

Much of this configuration was taken from the [security guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Security). Now you can apply the changes with `systemctl --system`.

Based partially off [my earlier article](http://hoverbear.org/2015/03/06/rust-travis-github-pages/) I've set up a repository [here](https://github.com/Hoverbear/acm-pandoc-paper) that demonstrates how to use Travis CI to build yourself ACM styled PDFs (along with fairly decent looking HTML versions) out of a simple `pandoc` markdown document!

Since it *is* a paper generator, you can see the generated HTML instructions how to use it [here](https://hoverbear.github.io/acm-pandoc-paper/) or the PDF [here](https://hoverbear.github.io/acm-pandoc-paper/paper.pdf).

Enjoy, please feel **encouraged** to send a pull request!

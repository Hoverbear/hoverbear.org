In April, I will be graduating from University. It's pretty darn exciting! Once
that's happened I'll officially have a Computer Science Degree with a Networking
option, meaning I focused primarily on networking for my upper year studies.
I'll be completing my degree with (approximately) a 7.75 (out of 9.00) GPA and
I'm pretty proud of that!

I've been placing a lot of thought into what comes next for me, and the only
solid decision I've come to is that *it's dependent on external factors*. The
problem with trying to build a plan is that many of the factors I have little
control over.

What choices I make, and where my next years take me, will be dependent the
opportunities which I am able to seize and which present themselves to me. In
the past few years I've been **incredibly** lucky to have had a grand number of
opportunities to engage with all sorts of amazing people and organizations. I'd
like to continue that.

### What I Seek

Primarily, I wish to create positive change in our world and improve the quality
of life for our people. Not a small goal, and not one with a clear answer
either. We in technology are granted tremendous opportunities to create change,
but we are also burdened with the responsibility of ensuring what we create is
done responsibly, and does not become corrupted.

I seek somewhere that encourages its employees to face these responsibilities
and grasp at the opportunities, even if they are slightly out of your grasp.
A good organization or company will draw together bright, compassionate
humans with a shared vision, and these humans support and uplift one another,
helping the grow. *I don't want to stop growing, and I don't want others to
stop growing.*

Secondarily, I seek self-fulfillment of my dreams and aspirations. This draws me
towards particular fields and disciplines for a variety of abstract ideals and
reasonings. I am passionate about open source, space, BCI, privacy, operations,
and networks, any organizations who might offer me opportunities in such fields,
especially space, will find me an enthusiastic applicant.

Other fields, of course, are of great interest to me, and I'm always eager to
learn new disciplines and ideas. In my opinion one of the greatest things about
learning computer science is the utility you are able to bring to other fields,
and the opportunity for you to learn while doing so.

### Interested?

If you've read the above, and happen to be looking for new people to bring onto
your team, then please do get in touch with me. I'm andrew@hoverbear.org
([gpg](https://keybase.io/hoverbear)).

For those who I've already been in touch with, again, thank you for your time
and interest in me. I look forward to reaching out to you in the coming months
to revisit our discussions.

Oh, and **Happy New Year!** I hope you have a great one!

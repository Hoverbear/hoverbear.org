This year helped again with Gathering Our Voices. I worked in the same capacity as previous years and had a similarly great time.

Rather than talking at length about events I'd rather share pictures. All of these photos were taken by my friend Geoff Howe. All images are wholly owned by the BCAAFC and you may not reproduce or use them in anything without their permission.

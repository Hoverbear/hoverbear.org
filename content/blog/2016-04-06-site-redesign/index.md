I've begun redesigning my website with my own theme! With school finishing and new employment looming I decided to take the time to make my site truly my own.

As a result I've rewritten all of the Jekyll liquid templates and styles myself and have been having a lot of fun learning how to use things like `display: flexbox`. I'm sure there will be bugs and people will have suggestions on how to improve things, please feel welcome to [email](mailto:ana@hoverbear.org) me if you do.

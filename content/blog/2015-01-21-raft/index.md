I'm currently working on implementing the Raft Distributed Consensus protocol in Rust.

This is a project I'm doing for my CSC466 class at the University of Victoria, and I'm hoping to use it as part of one of my projects for CSC462.

At the end of the project I plan to release it as MIT licensed code. Please stay tuned...

I've moved my feed over from [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)! It took several hours spread across several days to transfer all of my posts out of Ghost since it's (experimental) export functionality just dumps a bunch of junk into a JSON document.

In this move **most** page links should still map to the same thing as before. This does not hold for images, diagrams, etc *(but you should have hosted your own copy anyways)*.

For now, [taxonomies]
tags don't work, but I'm working on that. Jekyll doesn't have that functionality built in and I don't know Ruby well. I'm going to work on making Jekyll more beautiful as I go, but didn't want to hold back on a transition.

So, hello Jekyll!

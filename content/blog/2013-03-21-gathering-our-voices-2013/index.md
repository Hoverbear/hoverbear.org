I helped plan and host the 11th Gathering Our Voices Aboriginal Youth Conference in Penticton, British Columbia. Much of my time was spent learning proper software design and refining the management and registration software I developed. This was my first 'real' software project.

![The registration site.](reg.png)

I developed Gathering Our Voice's custom conference management software using Mongoose (A MongoDB ODM), MongoDB, Node.JS, Bootstrap, and Redis. The software was deployed to Heroku. The implementation language was CoffeeScript.

> The event attracted over 1700 participants, the largest ever at the time.

Not only did I produce and provide support for the registration site, I also acted as an ongoing member of the conference organization team, providing technical support both in-office and on-site over the course of the planning and event.

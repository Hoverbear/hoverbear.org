Hello,

My name is Ana Hobden. I'm typically found online going by Hoverbear, 飘飘熊, or Schwebebär. I speak primarily English, but I also know a bit of Deutsch and 中文. I am a forward-looking human who is passionate about open source, community, technology, education, and space. I am a Canadian from the west coast, and have ancestry from Norway, France, England, and the Listuguj Mi'kmaq. Ultimately though, I am from Earth, just like you.

I live in Victoria, Canada. It's a provincial capital with around 92,000 residents. I grew up here and love the diverse population, green spaces, sustainable living, and laid-back cultural attitudes. It's also conviently located close to Vancouver and Seattle, with connections to most of the world. It's my favorite spot in the world right now.

I believe that having activities and hobbies keeps your mind and body healthy. My partner and I love going hiking, rock climbing, and camping with our Golden Retriever. We're also avid video gamers, cooks, and bakers.

Life draws me into many interesting adventures and teachings. I try to use this site to catalog and document some of it. While it documents edited and often well researched topics, it does not capture the true *texture* of life. When I write I try to take you along on my exploration, but that is by no means a subsitute for your own adventures. The greatest impact I could have on you would be to inspire you to explore.

Friendships are something I am constantly looking to build, if you need someone to talk to, or some help with a problem, let me know. I'd love to try to help. Alternatively, if you're giving your life some texture and wholeness, I'd love to talk and learn about how you are doing that.

Humanity is a beautiful patchwork. I will not view you worse because of your ethnicity, sexuality, gender, physique, or anything else. I will do my best to respect your wishes around pronouns, names, or anything else. I do not mind whatever you use for me. The most correct pronoun for me would be *she*, if you were curious. The only reason I will treat you differently or disrespect you is if I see you disrespecting or harming others. We're all in this together, we've all suffered enough.

You can get an idea of the projects I've been involved with by checking out my [Github profile](https://github.com/hoverbear/). Things like distributed consensus, protocols, data structures, networking, automation, operations, web development, and databases are very much my interests.

I've helped organize, or presented at, several conferences in North America, Asia, and Europe. If you're interested in having me offer a workshop or talk at a conference you are most encouraged to get in touch. I prefer longer, interactive sessions on intermediate/advanced topics.

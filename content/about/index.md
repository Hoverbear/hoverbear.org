Hello,

My name is Ana Hobden. It's pronounced [-aːna](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Rhymes:Icelandic/a%CB%90na), like the end of 'Banana.' I also go by [**Hoverbear**, or any of it's translations](#translations-of-hoverbear).

I live in Lək̓ʷəŋən territory on Vancouver Island, in Canada. There are around 92,000 residents in the city, and just under a million on the island. I grew up here, adore the cultures, green spaces, sustainable living, the island pace, and the community attitudes. It's also conveniently located close to Vancouver and Seattle, with connections to most of the world.

You may know of me because of my background in technology, but there is much more that defines me. My [partner](https://twitter.com/j_dowadi) and I love going hiking, road tripping, and camping with our Golden Retriever, [*Nami*](https://twitter.com/nami_num_nums). We're also avid video gamers, chefs, and bakers. You can get an idea of the projects I've been involved with by checking the rest of this site, as well as my [Github profile](https://github.com/hoverbear/). Things like Rust, distributed consensus, storage, networking, automation, operations, WASM, and embedded are within my interests.

I have ancestral ties to Norway, France, England, and the Listuguj Mi'kmaq. I am a patchwork. Humanity is a patchwork, and it is beautiful. I will not view you worse because of your ethnicity, sexuality, gender, physique, disabilities, or anything else. I will do my best to respect your wishes around how you define yourself, and will apologize when I make mistakes. The only reason I will treat you differently or disrespect you is if I see you disrespecting or harming others. We're all in this together, we've all suffered enough.

Life draws me into many interesting adventures and teachings. I try to use this site to catalog and document some of it. While it documents edited and often well researched topics, it does not capture the true *texture* of life. When I write I try to take you along on my exploration, but that is by no means a substitute for your own adventures.

Friendships are something I am constantly looking to build, if you need someone to talk to, or some help with a problem, let me know. I'd love to try to help. Alternatively, if you're giving your life some texture and wholeness, I'd love to talk and learn about how you are doing that.

The greatest impact I could have on you would be to inspire you to explore and seek knowledge.


# Background

Out of high school, the [VNFC](http://www.vnfc.ca/) changed my life: They invested in me. They gave me a bursary to start post-secondary.

While in University, I worked for [Science Venture](http://www.scienceventure.ca/) teaching and doing robotics clubs, science clubs, and on-reserve outreach, SIMBIOSES/LEED Lab (a predecessor of the [Health Data Coalition](http://hdcbc.ca/)) working on distributed privacy-aware aggregate health data, the [BCAAFC](http://bcaafc.com/) running the technical side of BC's largest annual (2200+ person) youth conference, and the [(Mod)ularity Squad](https://yvonnecoady.com/) Distributed Systems lab. I graduated in the top 15% of my class, I was the first person in my family to graduate university. Because others invested in me.

Out of university, [Asquera](http://asquera.de/) invited me to Germany to work with them. It was a great honor. With them, I worked on maintaining [Wheelmap](https://wheelmap.org/), giving Rust trainings to engineers at places like [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [RIPE NCC](https://www.ripe.net/), as well as other non-disclosable work. I spoke, taught courses, and co-hosted workshops all over Europe that year. Because others invested in me.

While in Europe, I was able to be a founding organizer of [RustFest (2016-2018)](https://rustfest.global/) and [Rust Belt Rust (2016-2017)](https://www.rust-belt-rust.com/). I was able to travel much of Europe and some of the US those years. I was so honoured to be in the orbit of the various hackerspaces there, and the time I spent at [33c3](https://media.ccc.de/c/33c3) and [34c3](https://media.ccc.de/c/34c3) taught me so much.

Later, I moved home. [PingCAP](http://pingcap.com/) recruited me as a Senior Engineer onto their fledgling international team. With them, I helped build [TiKV](http://tikv.org/), helped organize the first [RustCon Asia 2019](https://rustcon.asia/), and hosted (or supported) numerous talks or workshops.

At the start of 2020, life lead me to start my own consultancy. Through it, I am able to work internationally, create partnerships, and spark ideas. I had the pleasure of taking on a long term maintenance role in [Vector](https://vector.dev/), as well as running workshops with [Ferrous Systems](https://ferrous-systems.com/).

My company is a contributor to the [Natives in Tech](https://nativesintech.org/) organization, and plans to become involved in more. It was a supporter of [Natives in Tech Conference 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV8IpFhZmHs). The company has only been involved in supporting Indigenous led efforts since the start of 2021.

At the start of 2021, I was a Senior Engineer at [Maya Data](https://mayadata.io/) working on [Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/Mayastor).


# Translations of 'Hoverbear'

I have been honoured with many translations of my nickname into a variety of languages. You are welcome to call me by these names as well.

My nick translates to {{ internationalized_hoverbear() }}. You are welcome to address me by any of them.

I am always seeking to learn new translations, particularly for Restigouche Míkmaq (which I believe would combine Āoonpitkōgwĕk and Noosĕ'skw), lək̓ʷəŋiʔnəŋ, or W̱SÁNEĆ.

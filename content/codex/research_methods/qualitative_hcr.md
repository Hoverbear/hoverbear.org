In [*Roadwork Ahead* (page 8)](roadwork-ahead) the idea of *Qualitative Human-Centric Research* was mentioned. It is described as the "active consultation of people".

# Methodology

In this report, which dove into the sustainability of open source, it helped the researchers reach *flexibility* while researching. They formulated a large set of questions for interviews to draw from, then allowed interviewees to emphasize topics they cared about. The researchers allowed the interviewees to suggest questions back to the list.


In 'Roadwork Ahead' researchers chose 7 broad categories. I feel this is a sweet spot between too many, and too few.

# Complications

* **Complication:** The researchers in [*Roadwork Ahead*](roadwork-ahead) mentioned that the situation in [*On Trust and Transparency*](on-trust-and-transparency) between the *funders* and *grantees* unknown, and sometimes undesirable effects between relationships between the two parties. 
  + **Resolution:** The team in [*Roadwork Ahead*](roadwork-ahead) followed some examples from [*Simply Secure*](simply-secure) to place emphasis on trust and confidentiality.

# Future Reading

The researchers also mentioned [*On Trust and Transparency*](on-trust-and-transparency) in their notes.

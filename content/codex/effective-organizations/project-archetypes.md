In [*Roadwork Ahead* (page 14-17)][roadwork-ahead] and in [*Open Source Archetypes*][open-source-archetypes] the idea of *Project Archetypes* is brought up. They try to broadly grip at what kinds of organizations exist within the open source space.

# Archetypes, two ways

In [*Roadwork Ahead* (page 14-17)][roadwork-ahead] the researchers found the following types:

* **One-person Shop**: Independent maintainers who are responsible for some work. (eg Curl)
* **Collective**: Grassroots communities. (eg Nix Project)
* **Embedded**: Small projects used primarily by a larger entities. (eg Tremor)
* **Organization**: Legal entities with a distinct brand. (eg Rust Foundation)

In [*Open Source Archetypes*][open-source-archetypes] the researchers found the following types:

* **Business-to-Business:** Entities where being open is a core business feature, focused on working with other businesses. (eg Timber)
* **Multi-Vendor Infrastructure:** Large projects with multiple large stakeholders which create broad standards. (eg Kubernetes)
* **Rocket Ship to Mars:** Small projects with clear goals, where open source is an insurance or trust factor. (eg Signal)
* **Controlled Ecosystem:** Founder lead, community involved projects to support out-of-core innovation. (eg WordPress)
* **Wide Open:** Community governed, formalized processes and standards. (eg Rust)
* **Mass Market:** Similar to Wide Open, but with some insulation from a wider market of adoption. (eg Firefox)
* **Specialty Library:** *Fundamental* libaries which which are at the leading edge of research where standardization is important. (eg libssl)
* **Trusted Vendor:** A project with a trusted vendor, where open source is a business or development benefit to avoid lock in. (eg MongoDB)
* **Upstream Dependency:** *Fundamental* building blocks for other software. (eg OpenSSL)
* **Bathwater:** Vaporware. (eg heathcare.gov)

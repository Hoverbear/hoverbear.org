    <p>Doing good work is incredibly hard work. The world is constantly weathering your organization with new challenges to overcome, and new opportunities to grasp. I work with your organization over the long term to create capacity and capability amongst your team, preparing them for what is to come. I advocate for practical solutions and foster cooperation over competition.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can work together to build a better, more hopeful future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Current Technology Company Contracts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Small engagements (like workshops) available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise engaged with <a href="https://timber.io">Timber.io</a> in maintainership.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current PNW Org contracts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="mailto:consulting+orgs@hoverbear.org">Available! Contact consulting+orgs@hoverbear.org</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="vision-focus">Vision &amp; Focus</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Building capacity and capability for a more hopeful future.</p>
<p>- Hoverbear Consulting's Vision statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my work I seek balance and focus. Most of the time, I work with <strong>international technology companies working in the open-source space</strong> to build a healthy technical ecosystem and a sustainable future. The rest of my time I spend engaging with <strong>Pacific Northwest based non (or not for) profit ecological conservation, STEM outreach, or social welfare efforts</strong> to help give the region I call home the best shot of surviving the challenges of the future.</p>
<p>At this time, I unfortunately don't have the availability to service other causes, as much as I might wish to. These places are were I have found I can cause the most impact with the skills I have.</p>
<h2 id="services">Services</h2>
<p>Some of my favorites to offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Workshops &amp; Training</strong>:</p>
<p>I offer flexible, friendly, casual workshops or for groups of up to 6. Content is custom catered to your needs. </p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed Systems Building Blocks</li>
<li>Basic infrastructure training</li>
<li>Open source development for closed source developers</li>
<li>Networking Fundamentals</li>
<li>Rust in production</li>
<li>Rust at scale</li>
<li>Static site generation</li>
<li>Chaos Testing</li>
<li>Rust development</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical review or assessment</strong>:</p>
<p>You can contract me to provide technical assessments of your ideas, your existing projects, or new features. This could be as simple as code review, or as in depth as architecture analysis. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Business advice</strong>:</p>
<p>I have broad ranging experience working with international developer communities and have had the pleasure to be involved with the computing industry over 3 continents. I'm happy to share any knowledge I have gathered, discuss growth internationally, or assess the impact things like a software Foundation might have on your project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hiring leads:</strong></p>
<p>I am happy to provide you occasional leads on diverse candidates. I will work with your company to find folks who are a good fit through my interactions with our community.</p>
<p>This is not a paid service, and we must have had a pre-existing business relationship in the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open source maintainership:</strong></p>
<p>Ongoing development and maintenance of a growing open source project is no easy task. The main service I provide is long term, ongoing maintenance services. I can help your open source project reach your goals.</p>
<p>I prefer Rust projects, particularly in the distributed systems, networking, or embedded space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>
<p>I endeavor to be easy to work with, I understand you have your own requirements, and you need things to be correct for any due diligence. I'll work with you in most cases.</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our business relationship must be founded on <strong>mutual goodwill and intent.</strong> I provide a service to your company, and I will do so as passionately, carefully, and correctly as possible. If I find myself no longer motivated to work with you, or you are not satisfied with the outcomes of my work, we will terminate the contract under good terms and part ways like reasonble people.</li>
<li><strong>I am happy to sign limited term NDAs.</strong> I do not accept unlimited term NDAs, I am not interested in taking on liabilities which cannot be practically enforced, as this risks damaging the enforcability of the rest of our contract. Please choose a reasonable NDA term, and I will be very happy to accept it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
<p>When forming relationships with technology companies, I prefer to reach out to companies I think would be a good fit for my services. Of course, you're always welcome to introduce yourself and your organization through <a href="mailto:consulting+tech@hoverbear.org">consulting+tech@hoverbear.org</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to organizations, I'm really interested in finding more organizations whose values match mine. I'm even more interested in providing some help! If this is through doing some technology education for your team, help putting together an event, help developing cirriculum, or something else entirely, I'd love to have a chat. Please reach out to <a href="https://hoverbear.org/consulting/consulting+orgs@hoverbear.org">consulting+orgs@hoverbear.org</a>.</p>

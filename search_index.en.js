name is Ana Hobden. It's pronounced -aːna, like the end of 'Banana.' I also go by Hoverbear, or any of it's translations.\nI live in Lək̓ʷəŋən territory on Vancouver Island, in Canada. There are around 92,000 residents in the city, and just under a million on the island. I grew up here, adore the cultures, green spaces, sustainable living, the island pace, and the community attitudes. It's also conveniently located close to Vancouver and Seattle, with connections to most of the world.\nYou may know of me because of my background in technology, but there is much more that defines me. My partner and I love going hiking, road tripping, and camping with our Golden Retriever, Nami. We're also avid video gamers, chefs, and bakers. You can get an idea of the projects I've been involved with by checking the rest of this site, as well as my Github profile. Things like Rust, distributed consensus, storage, networking, automation, operations, WASM, and embedded are within my interests.\nI have ancestral ties to Norway, France, England, and the Listuguj Mi'kmaq. I am a patchwork. Humanity is a patchwork, and it is beautiful. I will not view you worse because of your ethnicity, sexuality, gender, physique, disabilities, or anything else. I will do my best to respect your wishes around how you define yourself, and will apologize when I make mistakes. The only reason I will treat you differently or disrespect you is if I see you disrespecting or harming others. We're all in this together, we've all suffered enough.\nLife draws me into many interesting adventures and teachings. I try to use this site to catalog and document some of it. While it documents edited and often well researched topics, it does not capture the true texture of life. When I write I try to take you along on my exploration, but that is by no means a substitute for your own adventures.\nFriendships are something I am constantly looking to build, if you need someone to talk to, or some help with a problem, let me know. I'd love to try to help. Alternatively, if you're giving your life some texture and wholeness, I'd love to talk and learn about how you are doing that.\nThe greatest impact I could have on you would be to inspire you to explore and seek knowledge.\nBackground\nOut of high school, the VNFC changed my life: They invested in me. They gave me a bursary to start post-secondary.\nWhile in University, I worked for Science Venture teaching and doing robotics clubs, science clubs, and on-reserve outreach, SIMBIOSES/LEED Lab (a predecessor of the Health Data Coalition) working on distributed privacy-aware aggregate health data, the BCAAFC running the technical side of BC's largest annual (2200+ person) youth conference, and the (Mod)ularity Squad Distributed Systems lab. I graduated in the top 15% of my class, I was the first person in my family to graduate university. Because others invested in me.\nOut of university, Asquera invited me to Germany to work with them. It was a great honor. With them, I worked on maintaining Wheelmap, giving Rust trainings to engineers at places like Mozilla and RIPE NCC, as well as other non-disclosable work. I spoke, taught courses, and co-hosted workshops all over Europe that year. Because others invested in me.\nWhile in Europe, I was able to be a founding organizer of RustFest (2016-2018) and Rust Belt Rust (2016-2017). I was able to travel much of Europe and some of the US those years. I was so honoured to be in the orbit of the various hackerspaces there, and the time I spent at 33c3 and 34c3 taught me so much.\nLater, I moved home. PingCAP recruited me as a Senior Engineer onto their fledgling international team. With them, I helped build TiKV, helped organize the first RustCon Asia 2019, and hosted (or supported) numerous talks or workshops.\nAt the start of 2020, life lead me to start my own consultancy. Through it, I am able to work internationally, create partnerships, and spark ideas. I had the pleasure of taking on a long term maintenance role in Vector, as well as running workshops with Ferrous Systems.\nMy company is a contributor to the Natives in Tech organization, and plans to become involved in more. It was a supporter of Natives in Tech Conference 2020. The company is only involved in supporting Indigenous led efforts at this time.\nCurrently, I'm a staff Senior Engineer at Maya Data working mostly on Mayastor. We're working on next generation storage technology.\nTranslations of 'Hoverbear'\nI have been honoured with many translations of my nickname into a variety of languages. You are welcome to call me by these names as well.\nMy nick translates خرس بالزن (khers-e-balzan) in Farsi, ಹಾರುವ ಕರಡಿ (Haruva Karadi) in Kannada, منڈلاتا ہوا ریچھ (Mandlata Hua Reech) in Urdu, , मंडराता भालू (Mandaraata bhaloo) in Hindi, ఎగిరే ఎలుగుబంటి (Egire elugubaṇṭi) in Telugu, பறக்கும் கரடி (Parakkum karadi) in Tamil, ਮੰਡਰਾਉਂਦਾ ਰਿੱਛ (Mandaraunda richh) in Punjabi, उद्या अस्वल (Udta aswal) in Marathi, പറക്കുന്ന കരടി (Parakkunna karadi) in Malayalam, ଉଡ଼ନ୍ତା ଭାଲୁ (Udawntaa bhaalu) in Odia, Udne bhaalu in Nepali, 飘飘熊 (Piāo piāo xióng) in Mandarin, Schwebebär in German, Парящий Медведь (Paryashchiy Medved') in Russian, Очучы Аю in Tartar, Gaudotājlācis in Latvian, Zweefbeer in Dutch, Flotatzen duen hartza in Euskara, or Latający Miś in Polish. You are welcome to address me by any of them.\nI am always seeking to learn new translations, particularly for Restigouche Míkmaq (which I believe would combine Āoonpitkōgwĕk and Noosĕ'skw), lək̓ʷəŋiʔnəŋ, or W̱SÁNEĆ.\nIntroducing Me\nWant to verbally introduce me at an event? Please, use this:\n\nAna is a Senior Engineer on Mayastor, she's from Pacific Northwest, and  takes care of a golden retriever named Nami with her partner.\n\nIncluding my biography/about on a website? Please, use this.\n\nAna is a Senior Engineer working on Mayastor at Maya Data. She lives on Lək̓ʷəŋən territory in the Pacific Northwest, holds a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Victoria, and takes care of a golden retriever named Nami with her partner.\nAn eager conversationalist, she'd love to discuss NVMeoF, rDMA, Rust, Open Source sustainability, distributed consensus, data center technology, and renewable energy. Particularly with underrepresented people, those working with non-profits, or STEAM outreach done through community partnerships.\n\nThank you for respecting me.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/about/","title":"About"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/":{"body":"","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/","title":"Blog"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/a-ghost-openrc-script/":{"body":"Whipped up an OpenRC script for Ghost.

They are a fast, safe, 'lazy' way of working with data structures, streams, and other more creative applications.\n\nYou can play along on http://play.rust-lang.org/ and by browsing here. This article is not a subtitute for the documentation or experience.\n\nOur First Iterator\nHaving everything twice as much is great, right? Let's take a set of values and double it!\nfn main() {\n    // First, we get a set of values.\n    let input = [1, 2, 3];\n    // Create an iterator over them.\n    let iterator = input.iter();\n    // Specify things to do along the chain.\n    let mapped = iterator.map(|&amp;x| x * 2);\n    // Do something with the output.\n    let output = mapped.collect::&lt;Vec&lt;usize&gt;&gt;();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", output);\n}\n\nOkay first some important things to note, even from this simple example:\n\n.iter() can be used on many different types.\nDeclare a value, then create an iterator over it. Otherwise, the value will not live long enough to be iterated over. (Iterators are lazy, and do not necessarily own their data.)\n.collect::&lt;Vec&lt;usize&gt;&gt;() iterates over the entire iterator and places their values into the type of data collection we specify. (If you feel like writing your own data structure, have a look at this.)\nIt can be used and chained! You don't necessarily need to .collect() values at the end of a .map() call.\n\nn at a Time\nYou can access the next element in an iterator with .next(). If you'd like a batch you can use .take(n) to create a new iterator that goes over the next n elements. Have a few you don't care about? Use .skip(n) to discard n elements.\nfn main() {\n    let vals = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    let mut iter = vals.iter();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", iter.next());\n    println!(\"{:?}\", iter.skip(2).take(2)\n        .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;());\n}\n// Ouputs:\n// Some(1)\n// [4, 5]\nObserving Laziness\nWe talked about how Iterators are lazy, but our first example didn't really demonstrate that. Let's use .inspect() calls to observe evaluation.\nfn main() {\n    let input = [1, 2, 3];\n    let iterator = input.iter();\n    let mapped = iterator\n        .inspect(|&amp;x| println!(\"Pre map:\\t{}\", x))\n        .map(|&amp;x| x * 10) // This gets fed into...\n        .inspect(|&amp;x| println!(\"First map:\\t{}\", x))\n        .map(|x| x + 5)   // ... This.\n        .inspect(|&amp;x| println!(\"Second map:\\t{}\", x));\n    mapped.collect::&lt;Vec&lt;usize&gt;&gt;();\n}\n\nThe output is:\nPre map:    1\nFirst map:  10\nSecond map: 15\nPre map:    2\nFirst map:  20\nSecond map: 25\nPre map:    3\nFirst map:  30\nSecond map: 35\n\nAs you can see, the map functions are only evaluated as the iterator is moved through. (Otherwise we would see 1, 2, 3, 10, ...)\n\nNote how .inspect() only provides its function a &amp;x instead of a &amp;mut or the value itself. This prevents mutation and ensures that your inspection won't disturb the data pipeline.\n\nThis has some really cool implications, for example, we can have infinite or cycling iterators.\nfn main() {\n    let input = [1, 2, 3];\n    // This tells the iterator to cycle over itself.\n    let cycled = input.iter().cycle();\n    let output = cycled.take(9)\n        .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;&amp;usize&gt;&gt;();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", output);\n}\n// Outputs [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\nSomething In Common\nDon't get hung up thinking that [1, 2, 3] and it's ilk are the only things you can use iterators on.\nMany data structures support this style, we can use things like Vectors and VecDeques as well! Look for things that implement iter().\nuse std::collections::VecDeque;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Create a Vector of values.\n    let input = vec![1, 2, 3];\n    let iterator = input.iter();\n    let mapped = iterator.map(|&amp;x| {\n            return x * 2;\n        });\n    // Gather the result in a RingBuf.\n    let output = mapped.collect::&lt;VecDeque&lt;_&gt;&gt;();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", output);\n}\n// Outputs [2, 4, 6]\n\nNotice how here we collect into a VecDeque? That's because it implements FromIterator.\nNow you're probably thinking, \"Ah hah! I bet you can't use a HashMap or tree or something, Hoverbear!\" Well, you're wrong! You can!\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\nfn main() {\n    // Initialize an input map.\n    let mut input = HashMap::&lt;u64, u64&gt;::new();\n    input.insert(1, 10); // Type inferred here.\n    input.insert(2, 20);\n    input.insert(3, 30);\n    // Continue...\n    let iterator = input.iter();\n    let mapped = iterator.map(|(&amp;key, &amp;value)| {\n            return (key, value * 10);\n        });\n    let output = mapped.collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", output);\n}\n// [(1, 100), (3, 300), (2, 200)]\n\nWhen we're iterating over a HashMap the .map() function changes to accept a tuple, and .collect() recieves tuples. Of course, you can collect back into a HashMap (or whatever), too.\nDid you notice how the ordering changed? HashMap's aren't necessarily in order. Be aware of this!\n\nTry changing the code to build a Vec&lt;(u64, u64)&gt; into a HashMap.\n\nWriting an Iterator\nOkay so we've seen a taste of the kind of things that might offer iterators, but we can also make our own. What about an iterator that counts up indefinitely?\nstruct CountUp {\n    current: usize,\n}\n\nimpl Iterator for CountUp {\n    type Item = usize;\n    // The only fn we need to provide for a basic iterator.\n    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;usize&gt; {\n        self.current += 1;\n        Some(self.current)\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // In more sophisticated code use `::new()` from `impl CountUp`\n    let iterator = CountUp { current: 0 };\n    // This is an infinite iterator, only take so many.\n    let output = iterator.take(20).collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", output);\n}\n// Outputs [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]\n\nWe didn't have to call .iter() here, and that makes sense, since we're actually implementing an iterator. (Not transforming something into an iterator like before.)\n\nTry changing the current and .take() values.\n\nSee how we could use .take() and other functions without having to implement them separately for our new iterator? If you look at the docs of for iter you'll see that there are various traits like Iterator, RandomAccessIterator.\nOut on the Range with Ranges\nThroughout the following examples you'll see use of the x..y syntax. This creates a Range. They implement Iterator\tso we don't need to call .iter() on them. You can also use (0..100).step_by(2) if you want to use specific step increments if you're using them as Iterators.\nNote that they are open ended, and not inclusive.\n0..5 == [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ]\n2..6 == [ 2, 3, 4, 5, ]\n\nWe can also index into our collections.\nfn main() {\n    let range = (0..10).collect::&lt;Vec&lt;usize&gt;&gt;();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", &amp;range[..5]);\n    println!(\"{:?}\", &amp;range[2..5]);\n    println!(\"{:?}\", &amp;range[7..]);\n}\n// Outputs:\n// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n// [2, 3, 4]\n// [7, 8, 9]\n\n\nGotcha: Using .step_by() doesn't work this way since StepBy doesn't implement Idx and Range does.\n\nChaining and Zipping\nPutting together interators in various ways allows for some very nice, expressive code.\nfn main() {\n    // Demonstrate Chain\n    let first = 0..5;\n    let second = 5..10;\n    let chained = first.chain(second);\n    println!(\"Chained: {:?}\", chained.collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;());\n    // Demonstrate Zip\n    let first = 0..5;\n    let second = 5..10;\n    let zipped = first.zip(second);\n    println!(\"Zipped: {:?}\", zipped.collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;());\n}\n// Chained: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n// Zipped: [(0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 7), (3, 8), (4, 9)]\n\n.zip() allows you to merge iterators, while .chain() effectively creates an \"extended\" iterator. Yes, there is an .unzip().\n\nTry using .zip() on two usize slices then .collect() the resulting tuples to build up a HashMap.\n\nGetting Inquisistive\n.count(), .max_by(), .min_by(), .all(), and .any(), are common ways to inquire into an iterator.\n#![feature(core)] // Must be run on nightly at time of publishing.\n#[derive(Eq, PartialEq, Debug)]\nenum BearSpecies { Brown, Black, Polar, Grizzly }\n\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct Bear {\n    species: BearSpecies,\n    age: usize\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let bears = [\n        Bear { species: BearSpecies::Brown, age: 5 },\n        Bear { species: BearSpecies::Black, age: 12 },\n        Bear { species: BearSpecies::Polar, age: 15 },\n        Bear { species: BearSpecies::Grizzly, age: 16 },\n    ];\n    // Max/Min of a set.\n    let oldest = bears.iter().max_by(|x| x.age);\n    let youngest = bears.iter().min_by(|x| x.age);\n    println!(\"Oldest: {:?}\\nYoungest: {:?}\", oldest, youngest);\n    // Any/All\n    let has_polarbear = bears.iter().any(|x| {\n        x.species == BearSpecies::Polar\n    });\n    let all_minors = bears.iter().all(|x| {\n        x.age &lt;= 18\n    });\n    println!(\"At least one polarbear?: {:?}\", has_polarbear);\n    println!(\"Are they all minors? (&lt;18): {:?}\", all_minors);\n}\n// Outputs:\n// Oldest: Some(Bear { species: Grizzly, age: 16 })\n// Youngest: Some(Bear { species: Brown, age: 5 })\n// At least one polarbear?: true\n// Are they all minors? (&lt;18): true\n\n\nTry using the same iterator all of the above calls. .any() is the only one that borrows mutably, and won't work the same as the others. This is because it might not necessarily consume the entire iterator.\n\nFilter, Map, Red... Wait... Fold\nIf you're used to Javascript like me, you probably expect the holy trinity of .filter(), .map(), .reduce(). Well, they're all there in Rust too, but .reduce() is called .fold() which I kind of prefer.\nA basic example:\nfn main() {\n    let input = 1..10;\n    let output = input\n        .filter(|&amp;item| item % 2 == 0) // Keep Evens\n        .map(|item| item * 2) // Multiply by two.\n        .fold(0, |accumulator, item| accumulator + item);\n    println!(\"{}\", output);\n}\n\nOf course, don't start trying to be too clever, the above could simply be:\nfn main() {\n    let input = 1..10;\n    let output = input\n        .fold(0, |acc, item| {\n            if b % 2 == 0 {\n                acc + (item*2)\n            } else {\n                acc\n            }\n        });\n    println!(\"{}\", output);\n}\n\nThe ability to approach problems like this in multiple ways allows Rust to be quite flexible and expressive.\nSplit &amp; Scan\nThere is also scan if you need a variation of folding which yeilds the result each time. This is useful if you're waiting for a certain accumulated amount and wish to check on each iteration.\nSplitting an iterator up into two parts is possible. You can just use a simple grouping function that returns a boolean with partition.\nLet's use the two concepts to split up a big slice, group it be evens and odds, then progressively sum them up and make sure that the some of the evens is always less than the sum of the odds. (This is because even starts at 0.)\nfn main() {\n    let set = 0..1000;\n    let (even, odd): (Vec&lt;_&gt;, Vec&lt;_&gt;) = set.partition(|&amp;n| n % 2 == 0);\n    let even_scanner = even.iter().scan(0, |acc, &amp;x| { *acc += x; Some(*acc) });\n    let odd_scanner  = odd.iter().scan(0, |acc, &amp;x| { *acc += x; Some(*acc) });\n    let even_always_less = even_scanner.zip(odd_scanner)\n        .all(|(e, o)| e &lt;= o);\n    println!(\"Even was always less: {}\", even_always_less);\n}\n// Outputs:\n// Even was always less: true\n\nScanning can be used to provide things like a moving average. This is useful when reading through files, data, and sensors. Partitioning is a common task when shuffling through data.\nAnother common goal is to group elements together based on a specific value. Now, if you're expecting something like _.groupBy() from Lodash it's not quite that simple. Consider: Rust has BTreeMap, HashMap, VecMap, and other data types, our grouping method should not be opinionated.\nTo use a simple example, let's make an infinite iterator that cycles from 0 to 5 inclusively. In your own code these could be complex structs or tuples, but for now, simple integers are fine. We'll group them into into three categories, 0s, 5s, and the rest.\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\n\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]\nenum Kind { Zero, Five, Other }\n\nfn main() {\n    let values = 0..6; // Not inclusive.\n    let cycling = values.cycle();\n    // Group them into a HashMap.\n    let grouped = cycling.take(20).map(|x| {\n        // Return a tuple matching the (key, value) desired.\n        match x {\n            x if x == 5 =&gt; (Kind::Five, 5),\n            x if x == 0 =&gt; (Kind::Zero, 0),\n            x =&gt; (Kind::Other, x),\n        }\n    // Accumulate the values\n    }).fold(HashMap::&lt;Kind, Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;::new(), |mut acc, (k, x)| {\n        acc.entry(k).or_insert(vec![]).push(x);\n        acc\n    });\n    println!(\"{:?}\", grouped);\n}\n// Outputs: {Zero: [0, 0, 0, 0], Five: [5, 5, 5], Other: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1]}\n\n\nIt's kind of pointless to store all those replicated values. Try having this example return the number of occurances instead of the values. As a further exploration try using this method on a more complex value like a struct, you can also change what keys are used.\n\nFlanked\nThe DoubleEndedIterator trait is useful for certain purposes. For example, when you need the behavior of both of queue and a stack.\nfn main() {\n    let mut vals = 0..10;\n    println!(\"{:?}\", vals.next());\n    println!(\"{:?}\", vals.next_back());\n    println!(\"{:?}\", vals.next());\n    println!(\"{:?}\", vals.next_back());\n}\n// Some(0)\n// Some(9)\n// Some(1)\n// Some(8)\nPlay on your own!\nThis is a good time for you to take a break, get some tea, and crack open the Playpen. Try changing one of the above examples, fiddle with some new things in the API docs below, and generally have a good time.\n\nstd::collections\nstd::iter\n\nIf you get stuck, don't panic!

A vast world awaits us.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/a-journey-into-iterators/","title":"A Journey into Iterators"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/a-new-dawn/":{"body":"First of all, happy new year!\nIt's been awhile since I wrote anything, and there are many things I'd love to write more about. Sadly, time is a limited resource and I've been managing to keep quite busy. For now, I'll stick to an update about a wave of change in my life.\nGlowing memories\nOver the last year and a half I've had the absolutely wonderful pleasure of working with my dear friends at Asquera in beautiful Berlin. It has given me ample opportunity to learn, teach, and get experience with a wide range of topics. I will carry the lessons I learned, and the passions I acquired with me for the rest of my life.\nNot only did I have the chance to work with early stage tech startups, non-profits, and multinational companies shipping thousands of physical products daily, I also got to teach at companies I admire and respect, and work in a professional capacity to organize a number of successful conferences. All of it has been made even more enjoyable by the awesome people I got to work with, and the incredible folks they introduced me to.\nIf you're interested in doing some client work alongside incredible, ethical, and competent people, learning German, or wandering Europe, I could only reccomend working with them.\nThe simple passing of time brought me into a situation where my lease was over, and this meant I needed to move. For those not aware, finding new flats in Berlin is rather difficult, and I wasn't really looking forward to this.\nFinding direction\nI started looking half-heartedly well over a month ago, but I struggled. It wasn't because I wasn't finding things I was interested in, it was because I simply didn't know what I was looking for. I discovered that both in a flat, and in life, I was in a bit of a passive, limbo state. \nI was, in a way, satisfied. An abundance of great friends, frequent new adventures, and the lack of real worry about money meant I had little to complain about.\nWhile in Zürich for RustFest I chatted with one of labs at ETH about a possibile opportunity. It was rather spontaneous and I was rather surprised how seriously I took it all. Since I'm not particularly interested in a PhD right now, nothing came out it it. That interaction brought me to a realization: I no longer had a long term goal.\nFor most of my time alive I've righted my shoulders towards (sometimes lofty) long term goals, and walked. They are not always goals I reached, or even good goals, but they are goals nonetheless. I learnt not to treat these long term goals as the 'word of god,' but instead as an anchor with which to align my short term goals. The long term goals might evolve, change, or even be usurped entirely by another, but they still served their purpose.\nProfessionally, I found myself primarily working for clients where I didn't feel ownership over a product. I wanted them to succeed, and I wanted their product to be amazing, but the passion was different. It didn't feel quite as vibrant as the passion you feel towards something that is the direct, long term responsibility of your team.\nAcademically, I had little need to do research for what I tended to work on for clients, their challenges were rarely particularly scientifically interesting. Still, I found myself toying about with different API designs, reading papers about things like gossip protocols, but I rarely got to apply these ideas.\nNeither of these offered me particularly interesting or ambitious goals. Perhaps it was time for a change.\nSearching for a new dawn\nSo if I wanted a change, what did I really want? I found myself on an intense soul search, and eventually formulated what I was looking for.\nOn a professional and academic level it was fairly easy: I wanted to work in distributed systems, databases, and 'DevOps' roles. Furthermore, I'm interested in teaching, writing, giving talks, and offering workshops. There is more to life than your profession.\nFinding direction in my personal life was much more elusive. It ultimately came down to lifestyle, I realized I wanted to work remotely, so I could choose my location in the world. This is a big ask for many jobs, and I knew it would seriously limit my choices. Given that I wasn't searching with any urgency, this was not a huge worry.\nThis lead into the natural question of where would I live?. The truth of the matter is that most places aren't that far anymore. Going from Berlin to Pittsburgh for a two day conference is an entirely reasonable affair.\nI'm grateful to have friends in nearly every time zone these days, and I'm always happy to make more. No matter where I choose to live I will be far away from a group of friends, and I do not consider friend groups something that can be measured against one another. Conferences, events, and wanderlust will reconnect us regularly. Instead, I considered the place itself.\nIn that regard, I've yet to find a place I enjoy more than the Strait of Jaun De Fuca where I grew up. While this area wasn't a firm decision, it was a preference. Places like Iceland or Sweden were also of interest to me. Living in Canada would have the benefit of not needing a visa, and being able to plant some roots, even if I was frequently travelling.\nJust a looking for a systems/operations/research focused remote Rust job with lots of teaching. Impossible, right? Well, at least I knew what would make me change.\nA sunrise from the overlook\nThen, I found it.\nRecently I've developed more and more of an interest in databases. They occupy such a fundamental position in most of the systems we construct, are such a mystery to some people, and are so often neglected (despite their value and importance.) Seeing the difference between a properly administrated database and one which is just 'used' is incredible, and I realize that even small improvements in the database can yield huge results elsewhere.\nA couple weeks ago I connected with Dongxu Haung, a founder of PingCAP, and we had a great chat about distributed database such as TiDB which PingCAP is working on. I originally encountered the company when I was working on Raft-rs in university, they were also working on an implementation (also in Rust) at the same time, and we both learnt from each other.\nThe discussion evolved and I found myself talking with members of their team (such as Liu) about Rust, error handling strategies, benchmarking, Raft, and many other fascinating topics. I had a chance to dig around their codebase and was pleased with what I saw. Lots to do, but the code shows competence, the reviews show care, and the project seems healthy. This was a codebase I wanted to work in, that I wanted to help maintain.\nOn shortly after christmas I woke up to find a letter of offer from PingCAP, and I am happy to say that I have accepted this offer, and will be joining them as a Senior Database Engineer starting in April.\nWith this change of employment comes with a change of location. Since PingCAP has generously offered me a remote position, I expect to be back in the Vancouver/Victoria area, and am already starting to plan my travels from there. (The first being RustFest in Paris in May!)\nI'm looking forward to this new dawn, while looking longingly back at the lovely, wild night of adventure that proceeded it. In the meantime, please feel encouraged to reach out to me if you'd like to learn more about TiDB, TiKV, or the raft crate coming soon.\nTogether, we build the future, let's make sure it's a bright one.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/a-new-dawn/","title":"A New Year Dawns"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/a-useful-error-pattern/":{"body":"I've been playing around with a new project that uses a lot of collections of results, for example Vec&lt;Result&lt;()&gt;&gt; and asked some folks on Rust if they new a good way of transforming this into a Result&lt;Vec&lt;()&gt;&gt;.\nTurns out, .collect() can do it for you!\nuse std::io::{Error, ErrorKind};\n\nfn main() {\n    let results = vec![\n        Ok(0),\n        Ok(1),\n        Ok(2),\n        Err(Error::new(ErrorKind::Other, \"I'm an error!\")),\n    ];\n\n    let error = results.into_iter()\n        .collect::&lt;Result&lt;Vec&lt;usize&gt;, Error&gt;&gt;();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", error);\n\n    let results = vec![\n        Ok(0),\n        Ok(1),\n        Ok(2),\n    ];\n    let okay = results.into_iter()\n        .collect::&lt;Result&lt;Vec&lt;usize&gt;, Error&gt;&gt;();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", okay);\n}\n// Err(Error { repr: Custom(Custom\n//     { kind: Other, error: StringError(\"I\\'m an error!\")\n// }) })\n// Ok([0, 1, 2])\n\nIsn't that handy!

It's really beautiful out here and it's given me a chance to work on a few small projects which I've been wanting to explore for awhile now.\nAnyways, yesterday I set up a system that uses Ansible, Let's Encrypt, nginx, and DigitalOcean to terminate HTTP and proxy requests to arbitrary hosts. The intended use case for this is to have Github Pages sites able to be dropped onto a custom domain that is SSL enabled, but there are many other use cases which I haven't experimented with (yet).\nI was, primarily, interested in exploring using Ansible and DigitalOcean. It worked out quite well http://hoverbear.org/ is running on it at the moment!\n\nWithout further ado, you can check out the repository here. Trying it out on a test subdomain should be quite cheap (in the order of a few cents) and it's rather interesting to poke at.\nOn Ansible\nI've had some experience with Puppet, Chef, and Terraform in different capacities however I had only ever played with Ansible in a minimal fashion. In particular I'd only used Ansible as part of some course work on the GENI Experiment Engine which gives you slices of machines distributed around North America. I liked my experience and after a recent talk at the Berlin DevOps summit I was inspired to try it more.\nSo what's the differentiator between it and the others? Well the big differences are:\n\nIt is agent-less. Only Python and SSH are required. Puppet and Chef both require agents.\nIt's declarative, so there's no complex scripts happening. Chef is scriptable in Ruby, Puppet is also declarative.\nIt's just YAML, not some custom syntax. Puppet uses it's own special syntax.\nIt has a broad scope, doing things from creating cloud VMs to copying files. Terraform is limited to infrastructure, Puppet and Chef don't do infrastructure as part of their standard package.\nIt isn't particularly opinionated about file structure. Chef and Puppet are a bit picky about how you organize things.\n\nSo that's basically it! Puppet, Chef, and Ansible all essentially address the same problems in different fashions and they all do so in a perfectly acceptable manner. I think it's pretty much down to personal opinion and experience.\nAs for me, I'll be using Ansible on my next few projects to learn more about it.

I'll be writing about motors next, but before that I wanted to share some small, short Arduino 'labs' that you can do either on your own or with your cohort!\nAll of these 'labs' are as inexpensive as we could manage in terms of parts, with the exception of the Arduino.\n\n\nYou're welcome to print, distribute, and modify all of these to meet your needs. You can email me if you'd like the source files. We use Fritzing for breadboard layouts.\n\nOn and Off\nFirst, let's start with a basic on/off motor. This gives us the chance to understand two particularly important concepts.\nUsing a transistor as a trigger allows us to safely control larger amounts of voltage with an Arduino pin. If we tried to just use a plain Arduino pin to power the motor we'd risk blowing out the pin as the motor tried to draw many more milliamps than the Arduino can supply through a digital pin.\nUsing a Diode to handle backcurrent helps prevent any damage that may come from the attached motor is suddenly stopped. This is a neat characteristic in and of itself!\nYou should see the motor turn on, spin for a pair of seconds, than turn off for two seconds. It will then repeat.\nParts List\n\n1x Arduino\n1x DC Motor (smaller is better)\n1x Diode\n1x Resistor (We used 5.6k ohm)\n1x NPN transistor\nWires\n\nBreadboard\n\n        Plain\n        \n    \nCode\nconst int motor = 3;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  pinMode(motor, OUTPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  // Motor on.\n  digitalWrite(motor, HIGH);\n\n  delay(2000);\n\n  // Motor off.\n  digitalWrite(motor, LOW);\n\n  delay(2000);\n}\nPulse Width Modulation\nIf you haven't used Pulse Width Modulation before, it's a way to use certain digital pins on the Arduino to mimic the behaivor of an analog pin, sorta. Essentially PWM makes the pin pulse at specific widths to modulate the signal. This can be used to provide varying amounts of power to something like a motor.\nYou should see the motor slowly speed up and then back down again.\nSupplies &amp; Breadboard\nSame as above.\nCode\nconst int motor = 3;\nint speed = 0;\nint amount = 5;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  pinMode(motor, OUTPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  // Use PWM\n  analogWrite(motor, speed);\n\n  // Amount will either be + or -\n  speed = speed + amount;\n\n  if (speed == 0 || speed == 255) {\n    // At a boundary, swap +/- on amount\n    amount = -amount;\n  }\n\n  delay(30);\n}\nReacting to Input\nThe last few experiments we just used code to change the speed of the motor, however this isn't quite what a quadcopter does.

For example, the time 'before' graduation, and the time 'after'. It feels appropriate for the moment. Over the other side of the summit is unknowns. Unknowns about the future, about ones place in it, and about what changes might come next.\nWhile it is convenient at moments to make distinct 'before' and 'after' perspectives, it is not accurate. Life marches monotonically from change to change, and each before time is a composition of all previous 'before' and 'after' times. After one change, another will come, and the current ominous 'after' time, and its unknowns, will become a 'before' time, with less unknowns.\n\nGetting offered a new job brings to a close one 'before' time, and brings about the 'after' time of needing to start doing that new job. Ascending a mountain to meet one peak will, often necessarily, cause one to gaze longingly at the next peak. To define an 'after' time with these new eyes.\nAt times a, not necessarily consecutive, series of changes could be part of a larger, overarching change. Larger peaks are still peaks, though some can carry additional emotions and weight. During other moments, perhaps the rate of change is accelerated, or decelerated. Sometimes this is under ones control, at other times it is not.\nStill, changes will occur. They will need to be handled. The choice to not handle change is still a choice, and rarely a good one. Instead, move with intention, build momentum, and support those sharing the journey. The choices and changes that come with them, should be informed not by advice or momentary framing, but instead by long term intentions and aspirations.\nWeathering the Storm\nIn times of strife and uncertainty it's tempting to shut down or lash out. It's easy to get desperate, to panic. To do something destructive, something against intentions and aspirations. It's these times that not rushing, where stepping with the right intention pays off.\n\nLashing out at a colleague for finding a bug in your code, or calling someone an idiot on IRC won't help the situation any more than dealing with the situation properly. Instead, it causes harm and division.\n\nOften though, the problem is not a want to solve a problem correctly, it is the problem of how to solve a problem correctly. This does not come easy. It requires tact. In the moment, when ones ears are burning, it can be hard to find that. Easy, poor choices present themselves at every ledge, every handhold during ascent. If chosen, they wobble, crumble, and fail, threatening the journey.\nIn some situations, there is no option for failure. What can be done in such situations?\n\nMoving from one side of the planet with a few hundred in the local currency to your name does not have an easy fallback. Failing a course often means you can just retake it.\nI have twice now crossed an ocean with only the possesions on my back and a handful of bills. Both times I could barely store shivering on my way to the airport. Both times I have dreaded the forthcoming changes. Both times I have not regretted it for a moment.\n\nWhile preparation, both physical and mental, can assist ultimately in dire storms of change there will become a point that is met unprepared. Then, all that can be relied on are intention, and aspirations. They must be a strong, stable foundation, even when the storm has stripped everything else away.\nEven then, sometimes the wrong handhold, the wrong footing, is sought. A small slip can be stabilized with the help of those along for the journey. A bruise or scrape can be mended by companions.\nRefuge Sought, Refuge Offered\nIt is only in moments of true hardship and strife that the truth of companionship is discovered. When those storm worn travellers are able to find refuge in each other they are able to recover and begin anew on their path towards the peak. Perhaps these companions will join for a long ways, perhaps not. Like all things, relationships are temporal and ever in flux.\nThis does not need to diminish or extinguish the flame that is held for another. Some companions are best admired from an entirely different peak, others just can't be let go. Don't ruin the 'before' time with an 'after' time that is toxic. Instead, this is possibly just another 'before' time, and paths will cross again. Best not to set off firecrackers in the loose snow on the path below. Avalanches often beget more in unpredictable places.\n\nAt brief moments in my life I have both been homeless (but stayed with a friend), and hosted friends who were in bad situations. With many of my good friends I have a standing offer that they can ask me for help or a place to stay whenever they need. I know they'd do it for me as well, but that doesn't matter.\nWhat matters is that they are still able to make their journey and share it with me.\n\nDuring times of slow change, or of high stability, it's possible to find fulfillment in helping others conquer their peaks. During times of instability it's hard to help others, but it can be very reassuring to watch a companion achieve even their smallest goals with, or without, help. It reassures us that it is possible to reach our own peaks.\nFind the Right Peaks\nIt can seem a tragedy to make a journey only to realize that the something is just wrong. It happens. Find a new trail, move on. While the path to the peak, or even the peak, may be different, the only thing to do is to ascend. So ascend we must.\nBeing able to adapt to a new path, or adapt the path it meet ones needs, is critical to finding the right peaks.\n\nJust because your dream job is at NASA (cool!) doesn't mean that a new junior position working on temperature sensors isn't a good thing for you. One step leads to another. This new job is still a peak, albeit a small one.\n\nApplying the idea of a feedback loop to how you evaluate peaks can help use past experiences to help influence the choosing of the right peaks to ascend. Chosing wrong peaks, while unfortunate, helps influence future choice.\nChoosing what one thinks is the right peak, only to discover it is wrong, can dramaticly shift the overarching path in ones life. These moments are deeply interesting, and often feel horrifying unstable.\nIf the situation is correct though, it is in these moments that we truly can rediscover ourselves, that we can align our intentions and aspirations to their new truths, and that we can start again on our ascent.\n\nOkay, good rest. Time to climb again.\n\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/ascend/","title":"Ascend"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/async-auto/":{"body":"I've been exploring the handy async over the last few days in the lab. One of my projects is a MongoDB API Adapter in Node.js and I was pleased by a novel way of handling control flow.\nasync.auto() is a function offered by the libary which allows you to declare a set of tasks and their dependencies, then the library determines the best way to compose the initialization.\n\nConsider the following dependency graph:\n\n        Graph\n        \n    \nWith async this could be modelled like so:\n(function init() {\n\tasync.auto({\n\t\tdbConn: dbConn,\n\t\tschemas: [ 'dbConn', schemas ],\n\t\thttp: http,\n\t\thttpMiddleware: [ 'http', httpMiddleware ],\n\t\troutes: [ 'http', 'schemas', routes ]\n\t}, listen);\n\n\t// Definitions of functions below.\n}());\n\nThe first parameter of the function is an object of tasks. They follow the format taskName: function or taskName: [dependencies, function]. Tasks with dependencies will only start when those have been resolved.\nSo async helps with the handling of dependencies, but can we handle dependant state?\nFor example, dbConn produces a connection variable, and schemas consumes it. The two functions look like this:\nfunction dbConn(callback) {\n\tvar connection = db.connect(someString).connection\n\tconnection.on('success', function () {\n\t\t// Return `connection` into the `results`\n\t\tcallback(null, connection);\n\t});\n\tconnection.on('error', function (error) {\n\t\tcallback(error, null);\n\t});\n}\n\nfunction schemas(callback, results) {\n\t// Do a bunch of stuff.\n\t// results.dbConn has the connection.\n\tcallback(null);\n}\n\nThe result values of any task which another depends on are populated into the results parameter.\nFinally, the listen function accepts a final (error, results). Note it's called as soon as any task returns an error, so always make sure to handle errors. Finally, results will have all of the return values of the tasks which were composed.\nThis provides a compelling way to handle composability and dependencies without having to deal with complex callback changes. Functions will be invoked as their dependencies are resolved, and it's easy to add or remove dependencies, changing what's available in results.\nGive this pattern a try, it's especially useful when combined with other functions available in async, like async.seq.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/async-auto/","title":"Async Auto"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/back-channel-keycloak-requests/":{"body":"While using Keycloak you may need to make authenticated requests between various services. How can this be accomplished with Immutant?\n\nYou may want to check this link to learn how to use Immutant with Keycloak.\n\nConcept\nIn this deployment, there are three components to the deployment, a Consumer, a Provider, and Keycloak. The Consumer makes a request of the Provider using authentication through Keycloak.\nWorkflow:\n\nUser visits Consumer, gets redirected to Keycloak.\nUser authenticates with Keycloak, gets redirected back to Consumer.\nConsumer uses the User's \"Bearer\" token in a back channel request to the Provider.\nProvider verifies the User's \"Bearer\" token with Keycloak.\nProvider returns data to Consumer which returns it to the User after performing arbitrary computations.\n\nPreparation\nDeploy out a Keycloak container, and scaffold a pair of Immutant applications. In Keycloak, create a Consumer application, and a Provider application with User roles for both. In the Consumer's web.xml, restrict the /backchannel route to only authenticated User roles. Do the same thing with /locked on the Provider.\nSetting Up Keycloak\nAs of the 1.0.0-3 BETA version Keycloak currently requires you to declare the scopes necessary for your application. In 1.0.0-4 BETA, applications will have full role access by default, so this section is not applicable.\nCurrently, Keycloak does not grant applications any \"Scopes\" with other applications, scopes allow you to restrict which role mappings are studded into an access token. In Keycloak, go to the prepared appliactions and under the \"Scopes\" tab, select the other application and give it the User scope.\nMaking a Request\nThe User will browse to the Consumer and authenticate with Keycloak, then return to the /backchannel route. Since at this point they will be authenticated, you can get their session and utilize the Token it provides.\nThe get-session function produces a session which can be utilized.\n(defn get-session\n  \"Gets the session, get the object with `.getToken` or the access token itself with `.getTokenString`\"\n  [request]\n  (let [{servlet-request :servlet-request} request\n        session (.getAttribute servlet-request \"org.keycloak.KeycloakSecurityContext\")]\n    session))\n\nback-channel-handler, which is bound to the /backchannel route, responds to the request with information regarding the users resource access, as well as the data sent from the provider.\n(defn back-channel-handler\n  \"A back channel request handler\"\n  [request]\n  (str \"The back call resulted in:&lt;br&gt;\"\n    (.getResourceAccess (.getToken (get-session request)))\n    \"&lt;br&gt;\"\n    (try\n      (client/get \"http://provider:8080/locked\"\n        {:headers {\n          \"Authorization\" (str \"Bearer \" (.getTokenString (get-session request)))\n        }})\n      (catch Exception e\n        (str \"Exception occured... &lt;pre&gt;\" e \"&lt;/pre&gt;\")))))\n\n(defroutes app\n  \"The router.\"\n  (GET \"/backchannel\" [:as request] (back-channel-handler request)))\nHandling a Request\nOn the Provider, lock down the /locked route in the web.xml file. Then, Keycloak provides all of the necessary facilities to handle and verify the request. By the time the request reaches the Provider, it's already verified that the user has access.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/back-channel-keycloak-requests/","title":"Back Channel Keycloak Requests"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/benchmarking-is-hard/":{"body":"If you’re an avid reader of distributed systems news like I am, you’ve probably seen your share of benchmarks. You’ve also probably stopped taking them at face value. Unfortunately, benchmarks are hard to get right, and even more unfortunately, many articles touting benchmarks are actually benchmarketing, showcasing skewed outcomes to sell products.\nSo why do it at all? Let’s take a look at some of the motivations of benchmarking, the common tools, and discuss a few things to keep in mind when benchmarking.\nWhy benchmark at all?\nIf you don't have reproducible, fair benchmarking, you can be blinded by your own hubris. Our contributors and maintainers of depend on benchmarks to ensure we don't negatively impact its performance. Often not having benchmarks is like not having logging or metrics.\nFor our business, benchmarks give us tangible, real data we can share with both potential and existing users:\nHow will new feature X impact the performance of workload Y that customer Z uses?\nBeing able to benchmark against these workloads can inform our development, and positively impact all users — not just the originating benchmarker.\nWhile benchmarks can be used for these noble purposes, they can also be used for evil. They can be used for benchmarketing, which skews the results in favor of a particular deployment. Sometimes it's hard to spot, and for some readers, the easiest way to understand if something is or isn't benchmarketing is to look in the comments.\nWhat makes it so hard?\nOn the surface, benchmarking sounds pretty easy. You turn on the service, you make a bunch of requests, and you measure the time it takes.\nBut as you start to dive in, the story changes. Computers aren't the same, and distributed systems are even less so.\nDifferent RAM configurations, CPU sockets, motherboards, virtualization tools, and network interfaces can all impact the performance of a single node. Across a set of nodes, things such as routers, firewalls, and other services can also interact with metrics.\nHeck, even processing architectures aren't even all the same! For example, our software (TiKV) uses Streaming SIMD Extensions 3 (SSE3), a feature that isn't available on all processors. This could mean huge performance differences between otherwise similarly-specced machines.\nSo instead of worrying too much about the specifics of how workloads perform on a particular machine, it's fairly common to focus on relative benchmarks between different versions of the same product, or different products, on the same hardware.\nWhile everyone wants to be incomparable, it's very important to compare yourself to something. Knowing relative numbers gives us the ability to understand how a new change might impact our product, or to learn our weaknesses based on the results of another product.\nThe status quo\nIt's fairly common to see articles touting benchmarks gathered off big cloud machines in fairly small deployments. The author will go over the deployment specifications, then run a few tools like Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) and Transaction Processing Performance Council Benchmark C (TPC-C), and show off some graphs comparing the outcomes to either other versions or other products.\nThis is pretty awesome, actually.\nBeing able to (mostly) replicate their deployment, readers should be able to replicate their results. It also gives readers a chance to see any configuration the author might have done to favor results.\nFor example, it would be hardly fair to test key-value store TiKV 2.1 with sync-log off vs TiKV 3.0 with sync-log on. There are big performance (and safety) characteristics between the two settings.\nComparing products can be even worse. Products with different features and configurations are hard to compare — especially if the author is an expert in one system and a novice in another.\nIf you're like some of our contributors, you might have smirked at a few benchmarks before as you saw configurations that clearly favored one product or another. They're as subtle as possible, of course, but they're often the key to understanding a surprising result.\nDistributed systems are complex!\nWhen you consider a distributed system, it's important to choose a realistic topology. We doubt a user will ever deploy  six stateless query layers (like TiDB) to talk to two key-value store (TiKV) services and one Placement Driver (PD) service, so why would we benchmark that?\nChoosing the right machines is important too. Production deployments of distributed systems often suggest (or require) certain configurations. For example, we suggest you use your fastest storage and memory nodes to serve TiKV. If most TiKV nodes were running on a spinning disk machine, it's likely system performance would be heavily degraded, and benchmarks would be skewed.\nWe maintain a dedicated cluster of machines that our maintainers can use for benchmarking and testing. This gives us consistent, reliable benchmarks, because the topology is stable, and the machines do not run other noisy VMs or services.\nAlso, distributed systems like TiDB are often flexible, and tuning can dramatically impact the metrics for specific workloads. Tuning the database properly to the workload can help us properly test features, and inform our users of possible easy-gains for their use cases.\nDifferent scenarios, different standards\nDatabases have an incredible variety of use cases and workloads. Understandably, there is no universal, all-encompassing benchmark. Instead, we have a variety of tools at our disposal.\nTPC-C\nThe TPC-C benchmark is an Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) standard that takes the perspective of distributing orders to customers. The metric it measures is the number of orders processed by the benchmark per minute.\nThe TPC-C tries to measure the essential performance characteristics of some operations portrayed through the lens of a company distributing products to warehouses and districts, and then on to customers.\nThe benchmark doesn't attempt to measure the impact or cost of ad-hoc operational or analytical queries, such as the effect of decision support or auditing requests.\nIt uses fixed, scaling, and growing tables, and has a number of operations, such as creating new orders, paying for orders, checking the status of orders, and inquiring into the stock level of items.\nThe benchmark defines strict requirements for response time and consistency, and it uses multiple client connections to do this. (An example of a multiple client connection is creating an order with one client, and checking for it with another.)\nThe TPC-C has been one of the more popular OLTP benchmarks for a couple of decades, and it is commonly used to determine a system's cost or power efficiency. It's useful for determining the common, day-to-day performance of an OLTP database.\nTPC-H\nThe TPC-H benchmark is a decision-support benchmark. It operates over a minimum dataset size of about 1 gigabyte, though it's commonly run on larger populations. It measures metrics through composite queries per hour. (The standard discourages comparing between sizes, which is misleading.)\nThe TPC-H tries to measure the ability of a database to handle complex, large, ad-hoc queries. It functions similar to how a data lake functions in an extract, transform, load (ETL) pipeline, staying closely synchronized with an online transactional database. Complex queries are run over the dataset ad-hoc, and at varied intervals.\nIn many ways, TPC-H complements TPC-C. TPC-H represents the analytical database which handles the queries the TPC-C doesn't.\nSysbench\nUnlike the TPC benchmarks, sysbench is a scriptable benchmarking system in C and Lua. It offers a number of simple tests, and allows them to define subcommands (for example prepare and cleanup).\nBecause it's scriptable, you can use sysbench to create your own benchmarks, and also use the included benchmarks like oltp_read and oltp_point_select.\nSysbench is useful when you're trying to isolate problem cases, or want specific workload metrics.\nYCSB\nThe YCSB is a framework and common set of workloads for evaluating databases. Unlike the TPC benchmarks, it supports key-value stores, such as TiKV or redis. It reports in operations/sec.\nYCSB is  not as complex as the TPC benchmarks, but it has a number of fairly simple core workloads that you can use to evaluate system performance. Workloads A through F each offer a simplified workload of situations such as photo tagging, session stores, news, conversations, and user settings management.\nPingCAP maintains a Go fork of YCSB that we regularly use to test our own database and those of our respected colleagues.\n\n        Cables -- Taylor Vick; @tvick on Unsplash\n        \n    \nWhat makes a good benchmark?\nThe best benchmark has two things going for it: It is reproducible and convincing.\nAs we discussed earlier, when you benchmark a distributed system there are a wide variety of variables. Choosing and detailing the topology, hardware, and configuration of the deployment is key for reproducibility. If you're testing multiple products, make their configurations as equivalent as possible.\nIt's not fair to compare an in-memory, single-node service against a persisted, redundant service. Pay attention to consistency guarantees in the documentation. If one database uses snapshot isolation by default, and the other requires you to enable it, make sure to make the configurations consistent so the comparison is fair.\nBeing convincing also involves accepting your weaknesses. A benchmark result where your preferred database clearly outperforms all the others in every result feels a lot like benchmarketing. Including outcomes that don't favor your preferred database can help keep you honest, and show folks you aren't trying to be evil.\nHow to make a decent benchmark\nBefore we even get started on making a benchmark, we need to Read Those Fricking Manuals™ for each of the databases we'd like to benchmark, as well as each of the tools or workloads we want to benchmark. Understand what the tools are good at, and what they're bad at.\nNumbers that are just numbers mean nothing  — you must have an understanding of what you have benchmarked, and what the results mean. You should ensure that the benchmark configurations, specs, and topologies are all realistic and appropriate for the situation.\nPay attention to tuning guides or recommended deployment options. If possible, use official deployment tools like TiDB Ansible or TiDB Operator, because they often are built to handle things like essential OS configuration.\nIf you're looking for a model to start from, our friends at Percona do a great job with their benchmarking articles like PostgreSQL and MySQL: Millions of Queries per Second.\nFocus on a realistic metric\nThe TPC-C and TPC-H don't focus on just plain operations/second. TPC-H only measures complex queries. In contrast, TPC-C doesn't consider ad-hoc or complex queries, it just measures how many orders can be processed. Consider the use cases that you need to evaluate, and find or create a benchmark that is an appropriate match.\nSince you're considering a distributed system, you should also consider testing the database over different latencies or failure cases. You can use tools like traffic control (tc) to introduce delays or unreliability in a controlled way.\nYou should also consider what percentiles you're interested in, and how much outliers mean to you. Measuring only the 99th percentile of requests can be misleading if one system has some possibly problematic outliers.\nStutter can affect high-load databases just like other performance games. You can learn more about percentiles and stutter in Iain's (NVIDIA) excellent stutter article.\nDistribute the workload\nA naive approach to writing a benchmark might involve a single client interacting with a distributed database and running a workload.\nHowever this is rarely a realistic situation. It's much more likely that a large number of clients will be interacting with the database. Consider the TPC-C. It's unlikely that all of the warehouses and districts would connect over the same connection, or wait to take turns running their queries!\nWhen you benchmark a distributed system intended to handle a high volume of traffic, like TiDB, using only one connection will almost certainly result in your benchmarking tool becoming bottlenecked. Instead of benchmarking the database, you're actually benchmarking the tool!\nInstead, it's better to use multiple connections like TPC-C and sysbench do. Not only is this more realistic, in many cases it will result in more accurate performance numbers. This is because distributed algorithms like 2PC are impacted by network round trips, and the overall throughput of the system will be higher, despite the average latency being possibly higher too.\nDig into the why\nA good benchmark report doesn't just show off numbers and state “X is faster” — that's not interesting! Why is X faster? Is it because of mistakes? Or is it the result of deliberate choices that had consequences?\nTalking about why one test subject is faster not only makes the results more interesting, it also makes them more legitimate. If an author can explain why results differ, it demonstrates that they performed the necessary research to make an accurate benchmark.\nConsult the experts\nIf you're surprised or puzzled by your initial results, sometimes it's a good idea to email or call the database vendor. It's very likely they can help you find a tuning option or implementation detail that might be causing these results.\nIt's common for proprietary databases to have restrictive clauses against publishing benchmarks. We don't. At PingCAP, we love reading the benchmarks folks do on our database, and we try to help them set up fair, realistic scenarios for their benchmarks.\nAfter all, talk is cheap — show us the code!\n\nThis article was originally published on PingCAP's blog, it has been edited to fit the aesthetic and tone of this blog.\n\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/benchmarking-is-hard/","title":"Why Benchmarking Distributed Databases Is So Hard"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/blog-changeover/":{"body":"I've moved my feed over from Ghost to Jekyll!

Unfortunately the documentation is sparse for the library, and I haven't played with Cap'n Proto before.\n\nCap'n Proto is what's billed as a 'Data Interchange Format' and 'Capability-Based RPC System'. Or a 'Cerealization Protocol'.\n\n\nThe concept for working with Cap'n Proto is:\n\nBuild schemas out of it's schema language which define the data you're working with.\nCompile them into code structures for your preferred language using using capnpc.\nCode your application (optimally, using an RPC-style system, I won't be exploring that yet.)\n\nThere is a great talk here.\nPrerequisites\nRust\nFollow the Guide. You'll want the nightly provided by rustup.sh ideally.\nCap'n Proto\nFirst you should probably grab the capnp tool. If you're on a Mac with brew you can do this with:\nbrew install capnp\n\nThen grab capnpc-rust like so:\ngit clone https://github.com/dwrensha/capnpc-rust &amp;&amp; \\\ncd capnpc-rust &amp;&amp; \\\ncargo build\n\nThen move target/capnpc-rust to your local ~/bin folder, or somewhere else on your $PATH.\nDiving In\n\nNote, Rust is in flux at the time of writing and the information here may not necessarily be up to date.\n\nAs a first step, we'll set up a simple project to pack up an example person and write the coresponding Cap'n Proto data to stdout which we can explore with capnp.\nInitializing the Project\nUse cargo to create a new package.\ncargo new capntest --bin\ncd capntest\n\nAdd the capnproto-rust to your Cargo.toml\necho \"[dependencies]\\ncapnp = \\\"*\\\"\\ncapnpc = \\\"*\\\"\" &gt;&gt; Cargo.toml\nBuilding a Schema\nFirst, we need to generate a unique ID for Cap'n Proto to identify our schema.\ncapnp id\n\nYou'll see these at the top of every .capnp schema file.\nNow, Cap'n Proto has a pretty interesting schema language that seems adequate for most purposes. I'd be interested in see what it can (and cannot) represent.\nLet's save the example on the aforementioned page as src/schema/person.capnp.\n@0xdbb9ad1f14bf0b36;  # unique file ID, generated by `capnp id`\n\nstruct Person {\n  name @0 :Text;\n  birthdate @3 :Date;\n\n  email @1 :Text;\n  phones @2 :List(PhoneNumber);\n\n  struct PhoneNumber {\n    number @0 :Text;\n    type @1 :Type;\n\n    enum Type {\n      mobile @0;\n      home @1;\n      work @2;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nstruct Date {\n  year @0 :Int16;\n  month @1 :UInt8;\n  day @2 :UInt8;\n}\n\nThis format probably feels familiar to you. Types come after names just like in Rust. However you may have noticed the @0, @1, ... notations. This is so Cap'n Proto knows how the data is laid out and can evolve over time. If, for example, we start storing a Person's spouse as well, we would add spouse @4 :Person;.\n\nWhile designing your schemas, it's probably best to try to keep the @n notations monotonically increasing, that is, keep them in order.\n\nNow we can build the schema into some rust code with:\ncapnp compile -o rust src/schema/*.capnp\n\nYou can check src/schema/person_capnp.rs to see the generated code. It's not super pretty, but there is a lot going on.\nImporting the Schema\nCurrently, due to this and this you need to use your generated schema in the top level module.\nThis is the minimal main.rs file which should give you access to what we need from person.\nextern crate capnp;\nextern crate capnpc;\n\nmod person_capnp {\n    include!(\"./schema/person_capnp.rs\");\n}\n\nuse person_capnp::person;\n\nfn main() {\n\n}\n\nDouble check that this compiles for you use cargo build before going further.\nAside: Docs\nCurrently, there is little documentation about how to use the library, only a pair of examples. Examples here and here.\nIf you'd like to actually have something to reference, git clone https://github.com/dwrensha/capnproto-rust and run cargo doc in the directory. Then visit something like file:///Users/hoverbear/capnproto-rust/target/doc/capnp/index.html in your browser. Don't expect this to help much, but it might give you some hints.\nYou can also check the Cap'n Proto C++ docs here and here, as far as I can tell the interface is rather similar.\n\nIf you feel like being awesome, help write some docs!\n\nUsing the Schema\nKeep in mind, before we begin, that Cap'n Proto is a bit different than normal Rust stuff.\nCap'n Proto structs are build via the use of functions in the Builder implementation generated.\nIf you look in the ./schema/people_capnp.rs file you'll see:\nimpl &lt;'a&gt; Builder&lt;'a&gt; {\n\t// ...\n    // Setters\n    // ...\n}\n\nThat's how you can create your structs. Here's how we create a person and dump it to stdout:\n#![feature(path)]\nextern crate capnp;\nextern crate capnpc;\nmod person_capnp {\n    include!(\"./schema/person_capnp.rs\");\n}\nuse person_capnp::person as Person;\nuse capnp::serialize_packed;\nuse capnp::{MessageBuilder, MallocMessageBuilder};\nuse std::old_io::stdout;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Allocate.\n    let mut message = MallocMessageBuilder::new_default();\n    {\n        let mut person = message.init_root::&lt;Person::Builder&gt;();\n        // Setters\n        person.set_name(\"Foo Bar Baz\");\n        person.set_email(\"foo@bar.baz\");\n        {\n            // Use a Scope to limit lifetime of the borrow.\n            let mut birthdate = person.borrow().init_birthdate();\n            birthdate.set_day(1 as u8);\n            birthdate.set_month(1 as u8);\n            birthdate.set_year(1 as i16);\n        }\n        {\n            // Use a Scope to limit lifetime of the borrow.\n            let mut phones = person.borrow().init_phones(2); // 2 phones\n            // Unforuntately these borrows must be there.\n            phones.borrow().get(0).set_number(\"(123) 123-1234\");\n            phones.borrow().get(0).set_type(Person::phone_number::Type::Home);\n            phones.borrow().get(1).set_number(\"(123) 123-1235\");\n            phones.borrow().get(1).set_type(Person::phone_number::Type::Mobile);\n        }\n    }\n    let mut out = WriteOutputStream::new(stdout());\n    serialize_packed::write_packed_message_unbuffered(&amp;mut out(), &amp;mut message);\n}\n\nOkay, so, this seems fairly straightforward. The enum variants seem to work like in Rust, but there is some interesting allocation stuff going on. There are also a lot of scopes happening to handle borrow lifetimes.\nSo what's happening? The way Cap'n Proto stores it's structured laid out a very specific way in memory such that it doesn't need to serialize and deserialize data. When you're building a Cap'n Proto structure you're actually working with this memory.\nRunning cargo build we can run ./target/capntest and see the following:\n➜  capntest git:(master) ✗ ./target/capntest\nQb'�Foo zar Baz�z�(123) 12?3-1234�(123) 12?3-1235%\nInspecting the Packed Data\nWhat we got out of our program is what's called \"packed\" data. You can learn more about it here. We can use the capnp tool to unpack a struct.\n➜  capntest git:(master) ✗ ./target/capntest | capnp decode --packed ./src/schema/person.capnp Person\n( name = \"Foo Bar Baz\",\n  email = \"foo@bar.baz\",\n  phones = [\n    ( number = \"(123) 123-1234\",\n      type = home ),\n    ( number = \"(123) 123-1235\",\n      type = mobile ) ],\n  birthdate = (year = 1, month = 1, day = 1) )\nClosing\nThat should be enough to perk your interest in Cap'n Proto and get you started with the library. I'm hoping to write another article soon about working with Cap'n Proto input data (hint, change set to get!) and RPC calls.\nIf you can't wait to dig in, our worked example closely matches Address Book example given in the repository... Check the print_address_book function out here.\nDiscussion of this post is on Reddit.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/capn-proto-in-rust/","title":"First look at Cap'n Proto in Rust"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/command-execution-in-rust/":{"body":"One of my projects over the upcoming semester is to explore the Linux boot process and the job of the init (initialization) system. The init system is considered PID 1 and is responsible for a significant portion of userspace functionality. Common init systems on Linux are OpenRC and systemd. One of the key parts of an init system is to spawn new processes, like in command shell.\nExecuting child processes may be useful to any number of programs, but common applications include:\n\nShells\nInit systems\nLaunchers\nInterfacing with command line applications\n\nUsing libc\nIf you are familiar with C/C++, or other languages, you may have used one of the following functions:\n int execl(const char *path, const char *arg, ...);\n int execlp(const char *file, const char *arg, ...);\n int execle(const char *path, const char *arg , ..., char * const envp[]);\n int execv(const char *path, char *const argv[]);\n int execvp(const char *file, char *const argv[]);\n\nEach of these functions provide some variant of process spawning. Most of these are still available in Rust if you so desire. They can be accessed in libc. Note these are unsafe C bindings.\npub unsafe fn execv(prog: *const c_char, argv: *mut *const c_char) -&gt; c_int\npub unsafe fn execve(prog: *const c_char, argv: *mut *const c_char, envp: *mut *const c_char) -&gt; c_int\npub unsafe fn execvp(c: *const c_char, argv: *mut *const c_char) -&gt; c_int\n\nThis unsafe access is exactly what it says on the box, unsafe. We'll be forced to use C constructs directly and manipulate raw pointers, this is not an ideal scenario. In order to properly use this code we'd need to construct safe wrappers. But surely there is a better way?\nUsing std::io::process\nThe std::io::process module provides robust facilities for spawning child processes. In particular Command allows us to build and spawn processes easily.\nIntroducing Command\nstd::io::process::Command, aliased as std::io::Command, is a type that acts as a process builder. The Command::new() command sets up several sane defaults for the program for you.\nfn new&lt;T: ToCStr&gt;(program: T) -&gt; Command\n\nThe various builder functions allow for customization over the defaults, which are:\n\nNo arguments to the program\nInherit the current process's environment\nInherit the current process's working directory\nA readable pipe for stdin (file descriptor 0)\nA writeable pipe for stdout and stderr (file descriptors 1 and 2)\n\nIn and Out\nIn  a simple example, lets collect the output of ps aux:\nuse std::io::Command;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Spawn a process, wait for it to finish, and collect it's output\n    let the_output = Command::new(\"ps\").arg(\"aux\").output()\n        .ok().expect(\"Failed to execute.\");\n    // Encode the resulting data.\n    let encoded = String::from_utf8_lossy(the_output.output.as_slice());\n    print!(\"{}\", encoded);\n}\n\nIt should be noted that this is a blocking call, meaning the current task will halt until the completion of the process. This is acceptable for simple calls to the underlying operating system. .output() will handle all the tasks related to piping and spawning for you.\nIf you're dealing with multiple arguments, you can pass a slice, like so:\nlet the_output = Command::new(\"ps\").args([\"a\", \"u\", \"x\"]).output()\n    .ok().expect(\"Failed to execute.\");\nSpawning and managing the Children\nWaiting for the command to completely return is kind of lame. What would be better some way to keep track of the process and communicate with it.\nfn spawn(&amp;self) -&gt; IoResult&lt;Process&gt;\n\nThe Process type returned by .spawn() does just this.\nuse std::io::Command;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Spawn a process. Do not wait for it to return.\n    // Process should be mutable if we want to signal it later.\n    let mut the_process = Command::new(\"curl\")\n        .arg(\"http://www.hoverbear.org\")\n        .spawn().ok().expect(\"Failed to execute.\");\n    // Do things with `the_process`\n}\n\nWe can get the PID of the child:\n// Get the PID of the process.\nprintln!(\"The PID is: {}\", the_process.id());\n\nOr signal the process:\n// Signal the process.\n// 0 is interpreted as a poll check.\nmatch the_process.signal(0) {\n    Ok(_)  =&gt; println!(\"Process still alive!\"),\n    Err(_) =&gt; println!(\"Process dead.\")\n}\n\nNote: .signal_exit() and .signal_kill() are also available.\nWait for the process before returning, receiving it's status:\n// Wait for the process to exit.\nmatch the_process.wait() {\n    Ok(status) =&gt; println!(\"Finished, status of {}\", status),\n    Err(e)     =&gt; println!(\"Failed, error: {}\", e)\n}\n\nGotcha: Some processes will not exit until you drain their STDOUT.\nRetrieve STDOUT, interacting with it like any Reader:\n// Get a Pipestream, which implements the Reader trait.\nlet the_stdout_stream = the_process.stdout.as_mut()\n    .expect(\"Couldn't get mutable Pipestream.\");\n// Drain it into a &amp;mut [u8].\nlet the_stdout = the_stdout_stream.read_to_end()\n    .expect(\"Couldn't read from Pipestream.\");\n\n\nPipe into STDIN, also, wait for output and exit:\nuse std::io::Command;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut the_process = Command::new(\"grep\").arg(\"foo\")\n        .spawn().ok().expect(\"Failed to execute.\");\n    // Get a Pipestream which implements the writer trait.\n    // Scope, to ensure the borrow ends.\n    let _ = {\n        let the_stdin_stream = the_process.stdin.as_mut()\n            .expect(\"Couldn't get mutable Pipestream.\");\n        // Write to it in binary.\n        the_stdin_stream.write_int(123456)\n            .ok().expect(\"Couldn't write to stream.\");\n        the_stdin_stream.write(b\"Foo this, foo that!\")\n            .ok().expect(\"Couldn't write to stream.\");\n        // Flush the output so it ends.\n        the_stdin_stream.flush()\n            .ok().expect(\"Couldn't flush the stream.\");\n    };\n    // Wait on output.\n    match the_process.wait_with_output() {\n        Ok(out)    =&gt; print!(\"{}\", out.output.into_ascii()\n                          .into_string()),\n        Err(error) =&gt; print!(\"{}\", error)\n    }\n}\n\n\nRust's borrow check ensures that the process cannot be closed until it is safe to.\n\nWithout the scope, the lifetime of the the_stdin_stream would still exist when we try to call the_process.wait_with_output(). If it was the case that this wasn't tracked, it's possible that the_stdin_stream might be used even after the process is closed, something unsafe. We use a scope to limit the lifetime of the_stdin_stream, a function could also accomplish this. More info on lifetimes.\nInit's Perspective\nAn init system concerned about more then just the output of a process. It's concerned about the entire lifetime, which user ID runs it, what kind of ENV is exposed to it, what other processes depend on it, and where its STDOUT and STDERR go. So what would a full call to Command look like for an init system?\nLets say we want to spawn curl, a very long running process, and map it's STDOUT and STDERR to files. We'll also explicitly declare which user and group it should run as, as well as it's CWD and ENV variables.\nIn it's simplest form:\nextern crate native;\nextern crate rustrt;\n\nuse std::io::{process, Command};\nuse native::io::file;\nuse rustrt::rtio;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Open a stdout file. Note this is using the native runtime.\n    // The native runtime will allow us to retrieve a file descriptor.\n    let stdout_file = file::open(&amp;\"stdout_log\".to_c_str(),\n                                 rtio::Open,\n                                 rtio::ReadWrite)\n        .ok().expect(\"Couldn't open STDOUT file.\");\n    // The same with stderr.\n    let stderr_file = file::open(&amp;\"stderr_log\".to_c_str(),\n                                 rtio::Open,\n                                 rtio::ReadWrite)\n        .ok().expect(\"Couldn't open STDERR file.\");\n    // Generate the process very explicitly.\n    let mut the_process = Command::new(\"curl\")\n        // Slice of arguments.\n        .args([\"hoverbear.org\"])\n        // Set User/Group.\n        .uid(1000) // Don't know it? Check that user's $UID\n        .gid(1000)\n        // Set STDOUT\n        .stdout(process::InheritFd(stdout_file.fd()))\n        // Set STDERR\n        .stderr(process::InheritFd(stderr_file.fd()))\n        // Set the CWD.\n        .cwd(&amp;Path::new(\"/home/hoverbear\"))\n        // Set ENV variables.\n        .env(\"IS_EXAMPLE\", \"true\")\n        // Or remove ENV variables.\n        .env_remove(\"PRIVATE_VARIABLE\")\n        // Spawn\n        .spawn().ok().expect(\"Failed to execute\");\n    // ...\n    // Do stuff\n    // ...\n\n    // Wait for the process.\n    let the_status = the_process.wait()\n        .ok().expect(\"Couldn't wait for process.\");\n    // Output some exit information.\n    match the_status {\n        process::ExitStatus(x) =&gt; println!(\"Exited with status {}\", x),\n        process::ExitSignal(x) =&gt; println!(\"Exited from signal {}\", x)\n    };\n}\n\nAn init system often tracks many processes, how could you use the above code in a setting where multiple processes are needed? How could we utilize various constructs to monitor and augment the capabilities of a system?\nThis is only the humble beginning.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/command-execution-in-rust/","title":"Command Execution in Rust"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/command-line-args-in-rust/":{"body":"I was reading about the Docopt project the other day and really liked the standardized approach to --help prompts and argument parsing that it offers.\nLuckly, there is a Rust Package to play with!\ncargo new --bin foo\ncd foo\n\nAdd docopt to your Cargo.toml\n# ...\n[dependencies.docopt_macros]\ngit = \"git://github.com/docopt/docopt.rs\"\n\nNow in foo/src/main.rs:\nextern crate serialize;\nextern crate docopt;\n\nuse docopt::Docopt;\n\n// Define a USAGE string.\nstatic USAGE: &amp;'static str = \"\nUsage: foo [options] &lt;target&gt; &lt;task&gt;\n       foo (--help | --version)\n\nTask:\n    start          Starts the task.\n    stop           Stops the task.\n    restart        Restarts the task.\n\nOptions:\n    -h, --help     Show this help.\n    -v, --version  Show the version.\n\";\n\n// Define the struct that results from those options.\n#[deriving(Decodable, Show)]\nstruct Args {\n    arg_target: Option&lt;String&gt;,\n    arg_task: Option&lt;Task&gt;,\n    flag_help: bool,\n    flag_version: bool,\n}\n\n// Create a `Task` enum.\n#[deriving(Show)]\nenum Task { Start, Stop, Restart }\n// Teach Rust how to decode the `Task`\nimpl&lt;E, D: serialize::Decoder&lt;E&gt;&gt; serialize::Decodable&lt;D, E&gt; for Task {\n    fn decode(data: &amp;mut D) -&gt; Result&lt;Task, E&gt; {\n        let value = try!(data.read_str());\n        match value.as_slice() {\n            \"start\" =&gt; Ok(Start),\n            \"stop\" =&gt; Ok(Stop),\n            \"restart\" =&gt; Ok(Restart),\n            other =&gt; {\n                 let err = format!(\"Could not decode '{}' as task.\\nValid options are (start | stop | restart).\", other);\n                 Err(data.error(err.as_slice()))\n             }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let args: Args = Docopt::new(USAGE)\n        .and_then(|d| d.decode())\n        .unwrap_or_else(|e| e.exit());\n    println!(\"{}\", args);\n}\n\nNow build it, and try some tests:\ncargo build\n➜  foo git:(master) ✗ ./target/foo\n# Invalid arguments.\n#\n# Usage: foo [options] &lt;target&gt; &lt;task&gt;\n#        foo (--help | --version)\n# ➜  foo git:(master) ✗ ./target/foo -h\n# Usage: foo [options] &lt;target&gt; &lt;task&gt;\n#        foo (--help | --version)\n#\n# Task:\n#     start          Starts the task.\n#     stop           Stops the task.\n#     restart        Restarts the task.\n#\n# Options:\n#     -h, --help     Show this help.\n#     -v, --version  Show the version.\n➜  foo git:(master) ✗ ./target/foo -v\n# Args { arg_target: None, arg_task: None, flag_help: false, flag_version: true }\n➜  foo git:(master) ✗ ./target/foo bar start\n# Args { arg_target: Some(bar), arg_task: Some(Start), flag_help: false, flag_version: false }\n➜  foo git:(master) ✗ ./target/foo bar stop\n# Args { arg_target: Some(bar), arg_task: Some(Stop), flag_help: false, flag_version: false }\n➜  foo git:(master) ✗ ./target/foo bar restart\n# Args { arg_target: Some(bar), arg_task: Some(Restart), flag_help: false, flag_version: false }\n➜  foo git:(master) ✗ ./target/foo bar baz\n# Could not decode 'baz' as task.\n# Valid options are (start | stop | restart).\n➜  foo git:(master) ✗ ./target/foo start\n# Invalid arguments.\n#\n# Usage: foo [options] &lt;target&gt; &lt;task&gt;\n#        foo (--help | --version)\n\nThis works great!

We'll talk about why it's important, how it works, common issues found, how we use Jepsen, and finally we included a really short summary of all the problems Jepsen has found.\nIn the rest of this article, and in any Jepsen analyses you might find, you're going to find a lot of database jargon. Jepsen has our back! Located here you can see definitions and explanations of many of these terms.\nWe'll refer to serializability and linearizability often below, so you may benefit from quickly (re)familiarizing yourself with them.\nWhy is Jepsen so important to our industry?\nTesting a distributed system like TiDB isn't easy! Because these systems depend on multiple nodes coordinating there is a lot of room for failures. Networks and hardware aren't reliable, and when multiple nodes are involved, the probability of failure is much higher. Even still, deployments (and even nodes!) are highly variable in scale, OS, hardware, and workloads. It's impossible to test all of them.\nIs all hope lost? No! In Why Is Random Testing Effective for Partition Tolerance Bugs? Majumdar and Niksic formalized many failure scenarios and discussed how even a small, random subset of possibilities can be sufficient to achieve a specific coverage goal.\nIt's fairly rare to see projects and articles tackling the same kind of content as Jepsen. Vendors aren't always honest (by mistake or not) about what they do and don't guarantee. Projects like Jepsen, produced independently and rigorously, that test these claims are reinvigorating when compared to often banal marketing copy.\nThe Jepsen library helps automate and reproduce test cases, allowing the testers and readers to reproduce results for themselves.\nHow does Jepsen work?\nMany projects use the Jepsen library to test their systems before a Jepsen analysis, or never undergo an analysis while still using the Jepsen framework.\nThis is great. This is the goal:\n\nJepsen is an effort to improve the safety of distributed databases, queues, consensus systems, etc. \n\n-- The Jepsen website\nWhen a project wishes to improve themselves, a Jepsen analysis places the Jepsen framework in the hands of an expert operator who improves and expands the test suite. Often this involves adding aggressive failure scenarios or entirely new complex tests.\nJepsen (the framework)\nThe tool itself, also called Jepsen, is a Clojure framework used to set up distributed systems tests, run operations against them, and verify the operation history is sane and possible given the claims of the project. Then, it can generate some nice graphs out of that data.\n\nIt's kind of like a really flexible failure-injecting fuzzer.\n\nIn many cases, Jepsen tests for linearizability by using Knossos to prove that a given history (from a test) is non-linearizable. Jepsen also frequently tests for timing-related issues using libfaketime to create clock skew.\nJepsen itself doesn't rigorously enforce any specific tests, it's up to the tester to determine which claims, under which conditions, they wish to attempt to disprove. Once these claims are written, the framework can attempt to find examples in invalid states.\nWhile the specifics of tests are up to the author, there is a common suite of tests for testing certain claims, such as how required for snapshot isolation or sequential consistency.\nCommon tests include:\n\n\nBank: simulated bank accounts including transfers between accounts (using transactions).\n\nClaim: the total of all accounts should be consistent.\nRequired for: snapshot isolation.\n\n\n\nMonotonic: a counter which increments over time.\n\nClaim: successive reads of that value by any single client should observe monotonically increasing transaction timestamps and values.\nRequired for: monotonicity.\n\n\n\nRegister: read, writes, and compare-and-swap operations on registers.\n\nClaim: the operations should be linearizable (according to Knossos).\nRequired for: snapshot isolation.\n\n\n\nSet: unique integers inserted as rows in a table.\n\nClaim: concurrent reads should include all present values at any given time and at any later time.\nNote: a stricter variant requires immediate visibility instead of allowing stale reads.\n\n\n\nLong Fork: non-intersecting transactions are run concurrently.\n\nClaim: transactions happen in some specific order for future reads.\nProhibited in: snapshot isolation (Prefix property).\nAllowed in: parallel snapshot isolation.\n\n\n\nSequential: in one process, perform two write transactions (write_1 then write_2), concurrently read in the reverse order.\n\nClaim: no instances where write_2 is present before write_1 should be discovered.\nRequired for: sequential Consistency.\n\n\n\nIn addition to these tests, Jepsen uses Nemeses, an error injection tool which introduces failures to a system. A Nemesis can create partitions, fail processes, and cause other types of actions.\nHere's an example of some nemeses that do partitioning:\n\npartition-halves: Cuts the network into two halves, a majority and a minority.\nrandom-partition-halves: Cuts the network into two randomly chosen halves.\npartition-random-node: Isolates a random node from the rest of the network. \n\nJepsen (the analysis)\nWhen a project requests a Jepsen analysis from Jepsen, they're actually asking Jepsen to verify the claims the system makes, rather than check the system against a rigorous, formal model or set of requirements. E.g., if the project claims to withstand single node failures, then Jepsen can test that. In many cases, the project (or a possible customer) is funding some or all of the work.\nAll of this is quite important. This means Jepsen analyses aren't just someone \"dunking\" on a project. Moreover, Jepsen is validating the claims the project makes in its own documentation.\n\n        The Cockpit -- Franz Harvin Aceituna; @franzharvin on Unsplash\n        \n    \nCommonly found problems\nWhile not all analyses map directly to specific suites, tests, or claims, there were some problems that just seem to keep popping up!\nResponding too early\nWhen you write data to disk, it isn't immediately persistent on the disk. Instead, the data will be held in a buffer until it is \"flushed\" to disk. In the event of a failure, the data in the buffer may be lost, corrupted, or partially written. Therefore, in systems which promise no data loss, writes must be flushed before they can be acknowledged.\nThere were cases like in ElasticSearch 1.1.0 where writes were not fsynced by default. In these cases, for either performance reasons or mistakenly, a system responded prior to fsync. This created write loss during node failures.\nA good way to test this yourself is to kill nodes at the start of a network write, then validate if the data was saved in the node on recovery.\nMembership Changes are hard\nOver time, a distributed system is likely to grow, shrink, or otherwise change its membership to accommodate maintenance and load. These phases of transition often involve periods of hand-off, where failures may expose previously undiscovered bugs.\nIn the RethinkDB configuration analysis, Jepsen built a nemesis that would interact with RethinkDB's reconfiguration API to reconfigure the cluster. Then, in conjunction with another nemesis that creates partitions, Jepsen was able to create very aggressive membership change tests.\nIn several cases, testing for more aggressive error modes during these times of transition lead to the discovery of subtle bugs. In RethinkDB, a split-brain (multiple competing sub-clusters) could happen during transition, requiring emergency repairs by a human operator.\nSplit brains from a bridge\nSplit brains were a regular problem in many Jepsen analyses. A split-brain occurs when a cluster somehow promotes multiple leaders in a cluster that should only have a single leader.\nWhile many projects test trivial partition scenarios (such as {A,B,C,D,E} becoming {A,B,C},{D, E}), there were cases, such as Elasticsearch testing a \"bridge\", where nodes on each side of a partition were only partially disconnected, yielding split brains.\nAn example of this is {A,B,C,D,E} becoming {A,B,C},{C,D,E}, where C is a bridge between the two partitions.\nA - C - E\n \\ / \\ /\n  B   D\n\nIntuitively, we can see from the diagram that C should probably be the elected leader. It's totally connected. But this isn't always what happens.\nIn Zendisco (2014), Elasticsearch's membership system, there was no invariant preventing two leaders from existing, so it was possible for two nodes to believe themselves to be in a majority, and become elected leaders.\nPoor behavior on failed connections\nSome projects suffered from connection behaviors that are not ideal for operators. TiKV issue #4500 is an interesting example of this. TiKV 2.1.7 would retry a failed PD connection for up to 60 seconds on startup. However, if it lost connection to PD while online, it would retry until recovery.\nIn this case, if PD failed, then TiKV failed before PD recovered. This could lead to a state where TiKV nodes would never recover.\nHere's an example of a problematic case involving 1 TiKV node, and 1 PD node:\nkill(pd);\nrestart(tikv);\nsleep(61_000);\nrecover(pd);\n// TiKV never recovers connection.\n\nDgraph behaved similarly with interactions between it's Alpha and Zero nodes.\nInappropriate retries\nBoth CockroachDB and TiDB recently were shown to have issues where they could improperly retry a transaction using a newer timestamp. In CockroachDB, this could result in duplicate writes. In TiDB, this could lead to read skew or lost updates, as indicated by a drifting total in the bank test.\nIn TiDB's case, these could occur under the default configuration for two reasons:\n\nWhen one transaction conflicts with another, TiDB would automatically retry the transaction. (10075, 10076)\nIf TiDB lost connection to PD, TiDB would also retry. (10495, 4500, 10470)\n\nMisleading or incorrect advertising\nProjects like Aerospike suffered from making obviously false claims such as \"100% Uptime\" on their marketing pages. These sorts of claims ultimately only are a detriment to the project's credibility. These sorts of claims show either deliberate lying, or lack of knowledge about fundamental principles.\nJepsen testing showed in these cases that these claims were too good to be true. These kinds of problems remind us all to properly evaluate systems for our needs, instead of trusting in marketing copy.\nIncorrect claims by developers\nOften, Jepsen analyses test claims or \"sanctioned use cases\" by the developers. For example, RabbitMQ developers claimed to support distributed semaphores but was not able to provide the common guarantees associated with these structures. In the case of NuoDB, a developer made bold claims about the database's capabilities in relation to the CAP theorem.\nWhile these claims aren't sitting on the glossy marketing pages of the product, it's common for developers to reference official blogs and mailing lists when learning the capabilities and limits of a system. Developers of a project are typically considered trustworthy sources of knowledge about their product, so claims they make are often taken as true by users.\nInteresting notes\nDuring my review of Jepsen history, some interesting notes came up that may be of your interest. Here are a few of them that may hopefully encourage you to read the analyses for yourself.\nSerializability vs strict serializability: casual reverse\nIn the CockroachDB analysis, Jepsen talks about the differences between strict serializability and serializability. Serializability, but not “strict serializability”, means it was possible for reads to fail to observe the most recent transactions.\nStrict serializability means that operations should appear to have some order consistency with the real-time ordering. It implies both serializability and linearizability.\nError message compatibility\nIn ElasticSearch - 2014-06-15 - 1.1.0 it was noted that different JVMs serialize classes differently (e.g., InetAddress), meaning it was possible clients and servers would be unable to correctly communicate error messages from a different node.\nThis is issue #3145:\n[2013-06-05 09:35:20,480][WARN ][action.index         \t] [es-1] Failed to perform index on replica [rules][4]\norg.elasticsearch.transport.RemoteTransportException: Failed to deserialize exception response from stream\nCaused by: org.elasticsearch.transport.TransportSerializationException: Failed to deserialize exception response from stream\n\nUsing tools such as Protobuf or Cap'n Proto can help prevent these kinds of issues, as they have a well defined backward compatibility semantic.\nHow we use Jepsen with TiDB\nThe team at PingCAP uses Jepsen to test TiDB (which uses TiKV) frequently. This includes tests developed for the official Jepsen Analysis for TiDB.\nEach new release of TiDB and TiKV passes a check ensuring that there are no claims we have made which the Jepsen framework disproves.\n\n        The Appendix -- Lysander Yuen; @lysanderyuen on Unsplash\n        \n    \nAppendix I\nThis is a summary of each report's problems discovered.\n\nNote: Since Jepsen has expanded its feature set over time, these results are somewhat skewed, since some problems detected in new reports may have not been detectable in earlier reports.\n\n\nAerospike\n\n2015-05-04 - 3.5.4\n\nRoutine Linearizability violations and timeouts in read and CaS ops during network interruptions between nodes.\nCounter operation loss (despite being acknowledged) during network interruptions between nodes.\nSplit brain detected (via counter operation fluctuation) during networking between nodes.\n\n\n2018-03-07 - 3.99.0.3\n\nlost updates when more than k nodes crash (either concurrently or in sequence).\nwhen either process pauses or clock skew exceed 27 seconds, Aerospike could lose committed updates\nAerospike could inform a client that a write did not succeed when, in fact, it had\n\n\n\n\nCassandra\n\n2013-09-24 - 2.0.0\n\nDue to last-write-win semantics, even under perfect clocks, QUORUM consistency, and a perfect lock service, Cassandra lost 28% of it's acknowledged writes during an ordered mutation test on a single cell.\nIf a cluster is partitioned during around half of a test run, counters could drift by up to 50% of the value.\nRow isolation seems to be probabilistic at best due to duplicate timestamps.\nLightweight transactions dropping 1-5% of requests without network partitions.\n\n\n\n\nChronos\n\n2015-08-10 - 2.4.0\n\nPoor error handling and poor Debian packaging could lead to multiple copies of the service running.\nHard crashes in response to a network partition.\nIt is seemingly impossible to recover Chronos after a network failure.\n\n\n\n\nCockroachDB\n\n2017-02-16 - beta-20160829\n\nCasual reverses in insert order show a subtle example of how serializability and strict serializability differ.\nNon-monotonicity (decreasing values with increasing timestamps) as well as a serializability violation due to a cache not discriminating between transaction IDs.\nNodes coordinating a transaction may attempt to retry a request and receive an error, causing another retry with a new timestamp, resulting in a duplicate entry.\n\n\n\n\nCrate\n\n2016-06-28 - 0.54.9\n\nElasticSearch 1.7 as a data store meant that updates could be lost.\nDuring partitions or split brains the system seems to hold two different copies of a row with the same _version value.\n\n\n\n\nDgraph\n\n2018-08-23 - 1.0.2\n\nSchema issues could transform data in unexpected ways, including unexpectedly treating integers as floats.\nSeveral segfaults and deadlocks around cluster joining, mostly related to leader discovery when a leader wasn't present.\nConcurrent upserts on the same key could succeed, resulting in duplicate keys.\nSeveral delete anomalies, including deletions committed after a read began, occurred in part due to a race condition.\nClient-side sequencing race conditions meant clients could experience read skew.\nAcknowledged writes could be lost during network partitions in part by Dgraph failing to advance read timestamps on leader changes.\nThe same bug as above caused transactions writing to a given key to abort with a conflict, despite none existing.\nNodes could lock up during partitions, causing requests to time out.\nPartitions could push transaction timestamps into the future, causing requests to fail with outdated timestamps for some time.\nNo configurable retry loop on Alpha startup made recovery difficult for operators.\nWrite loss may occur during Alpha node crashes.\nAfter crashes Alpha nodes could return timeouts due to not having up been informed of a leadership change.\nDuring the cluster join process, nodes which received requests shortly after restarting could handle requests before initializing, resulting in a null pointer dereference.\nMigration read skew &amp;

Furthermore,the JBoss documentation isn't particularly tailored towards Clojure applications.\nSo, let's take a look at how to do this using the convenient dockerfiles provided by the JBoss project. We'll use Docker to simplify deployment and setup of Wildfly, but instructions for a non-docker application should be similar.\nCreate a basic Immutant application.\nStarting from a lein new app learning command, set up your project like so:\n\nproject.clj:\n(defproject learning \"0.1.0-SNAPSHOT\"\n  :description \"FIXME: write description\"\n  :url \"http://example.com/FIXME\"\n  :license {:name \"MPL\"\n            :url \"http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mpl-2.0/\"}\n  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure \"1.6.0\"]\n                 [org.immutant/immutant \"2.x.incremental.186\"]\n                 [compojure \"1.1.8\"]]\n  :repositories [[\"Immutant incremental builds\"\n                  \"http://downloads.immutant.org/incremental/\"]]\n  :plugins [[lein-immutant \"2.0.0-SNAPSHOT\"]]\n  :ring {:handler learning.core/app}\n  :main ^:skip-aot learning.core\n  :target-path \"target/%s\"\n  :profiles {:uberjar {:aot :all}})\n\nNote how lein-immutant is in the :plugins field. This will give us access to the lein immutant &lt;command&gt; commands.\nsrc/learning/core.clj:\n(ns learning.core\n  (:use compojure.core)\n  (:require [compojure.route    :as route]\n            [immutant.web       :as immutant])\n  (:gen-class))\n\n(defn handler\n  \"Comment\"\n  []\n  \"&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;\")\n\n(defroutes app\n  \"The router.\"\n  (GET \"/learning/test\" [] (handler))\n  (route/not-found\n       \"&lt;h1&gt;Page not found&lt;/h1&gt;\"))\n\n(defn -main\n  \"Start the server\"\n  [&amp; args]\n  (immutant/run app))\n\nAfter speaking to the fine folks on the #immutant IRC channel on Freenode, we determined that Immutant seemed to have some issues with routing while running on JBoss. The route /learning/test should be just /test as far as I am able to tell, the problem will become apparent later.\nDockerfile:\nFROM jboss/wildfly\nRUN /opt/wildfly/bin/add-user.sh hoverbear hunter2 --silent\nADD target/base+system+user+dev/learning.war /opt/wildfly/standalone/deployments/\nBuild the Immutant Application\nWildfly seems to expect .war files for deployment.

Future builds will be very fast as it won't need to pull the base image.\nRunning the Container\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -p 9990:9990 wildfly-learning\n\nThere should be a considerable log of output.\nTesting\nFrom there, you should be able to visit http://localhost:8080/learning/test and see \"Hello World\" in bold text. Visiting any other /learning/* url should yield a bold \"Page not found\" with a smaller 404 error underneath. Visiting a URL like /learn will give a different 404 page.\nVisiting the Wildfly console\nYou should be able to visit http://localhost:9990/console/App.html and view the Wildfly admin interface, you might need to log in with details from the Dockerfile.\nBrowsing to the \"Runtime &gt; Manage Deployments\" page will allow you to play with some settings.\nNotes\nThis is, obviously, not a production deployment.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/deploying-immutant-to-wildfly/","title":"Deploying Immutant to Wildfly"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/docker-archlinux/":{"body":"Back in 2014 when I was learning about Docker I got around to making a base image for Arch Linux.

I don't feel comfortable running containers I haven't seen the build process for, and you shouldn't either.\nWhile the Docker Hub has \"Automated\" builds there doesn't seem to be much of a solution for having trusted base images, only images built via a Dockerfile. Perhaps there is a way to scheme and subvert this via the scratch image but I did not find this avenue enjoyable.\nThankfully, Travis did this job stellarly after a few hiccups. The biggest problem was that Travis runs a version of Ubuntu LTS and the normal Arch install process assumes it's happening on a relatively recent Linux, if not Arch itself.\nI got around this problem in a slightly dirty way and pinned recent versions of the necessary packages, then upgraded the host into a (slightly terrifying) abomination. I'd like to find a cleaner way of doing this, possibly from inside of a docker container like in the Makefile.\nPlaying Around\nWhat's a good blog post without some fun examples?\nSpawning 10 Arch containers in parallel and having them all pipe to the same file:\nfor i in {1..10}; do (docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/here hoverbear/archlinux /bin/bash -c \"echo $i &gt;&gt; here/checkin\" &amp;); done\n\nA few seconds later:\n$ cat checkin\n6\n3\n4\n5\n1\n8\n10\n2\n7\n9\n\nMaking an image to build your favorite Rust project:\nFROM hoverbear/archlinux\nMAINTAINER Ana Hobden &lt;ana@hoverbear.org&gt;\n\n# It's always a good idea to update Arch, then install deps.\nRUN pacman -Syu\nRUN pacman -S git file awk gcc --noconfirm\n\n# Install Multirust\nRUN git clone --recursive https://github.com/brson/multirust\nWORKDIR multirust\nRUN git submodule update --init\nRUN ./build.sh\nRUN ./install.sh\n\nRUN multirust default \"nightly\"\n\n# /source - Should mount the user code.\nVOLUME [ \"/source\" ]\n\n# Change the Workdir to /source\nWORKDIR /source\n\nRunning it inside your favorite project folder:\ndocker run -t -i --rm=true -v $(pwd):/source rust cargo build\n\nYou can even get this image here if you'd like!\nConclusion\nI hope you have a great time using this image and please let me know if there is any way I can make it better!\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/docker-archlinux/","title":"Arch Linux on Docker Revisited"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/exciting-times/":{"body":"The next few weeks are full of excitement and busy-ness! First up is the Meetup in San Fran (See our planning). I can't wait! It will be so fun to meet many people I've already met in IRC and through the community!\nIf you'd like to do something, or show me around the city, let me know! I've never been to the USA before, let alone San Fransisco.\nAfter that I'm moving into a new place! A friend and I landed a great location for the next year and we're looking forward to the changes ahead. Once I'm settled in classes will be starting and I have a very busy term ahead!\n\nAnother thing I'm doing this semester is helping teach an intro course! Check it out!\nI'm trying to focus on my current responsibilities and temporally important tasks for the next couple weeks. Other than perhaps some discussion and recap of the meetup and some development on the raft-rs repository I don't think I'll be undertaking anything new!\n\nP.S. We renamed our repository to raft-rs\n\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/exciting-times/","title":"Exciting Times"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/finding-direction-defining-goals/":{"body":"The simple passage of time changes us. Our personalities, identities, social circles, fears, and passions all shift to meet our needs throughout life. As we grow and mature, we must reconcile our past and resolve ourselves to the future. Time trawls up existential questions again and again: Who am I? What is my purpose? What do I want in life? What am I willing to struggle with? What happens if I fail? What could have been, but never will be? These kinds of questions can prompt deep introspection, and act as reasons for change.\nMy life is unrecognizable compared to even two years ago, and with these changes, new answers to those questions started to form. I found myself desiring a change.\n\nIn the past weeks, this has spurned a catalyst. I've shifted my professional gears and am now embarking on the adventure of sole proprietorship, Hoverbear Consulting! As part of this shift, PingCAP and I are taking separate paths and I'll be working with new organizations to build their capacity. The first organization I'll be working with is Timber on a long term contract to grow the Vector ecosystem. More below!\nA heavy-hearted, but necessary goodbye\n\n        PingCAP Annual party, 2019\n        \n    \nMy departure from PingCAP was a bit of a surprise. The company is carefully trying to make their processes more efficent, refined, and welcoming to contributors. As part of that, I found myself offered a new position. Yet because of my changing answers to those existential questions, I found myself wanting something different.\nThe catalyst triggered.\nI was happy at PingCAP. I think PingCAP is generally going in the right directions. I think PingCAP is very genuine in their efforts to be good global open source citizens. I think they are grappling with the same struggles as everyone else is, and I think they were doing their best to overcome them.\nI'm proud of them and what we accomplished in the last two years. I'm excited to see the things coming next from such a great team!\nAs for the TiKV community, I plan to bring my involvement to an end in a good way. Though I've ended my formal involvement with the organization, I want to keep in contact with the wonderful folks I've met in the community. So please, don't be a stranger. You can always get in touch! ❤️\nForging Hoverbear Consulting\n\n        A forge&nbsp;- @neonbrand\n        \n    \nDuring university, I worked as an employeee as part of a number of organizations, like the BCAAFC, a couple research labs, and Science Venture. Often at the same time. After, I worked in Germany as part of the software consultancy Asquera with some really incredible organizations, including my favorite, the Wheelmap. For PingCAP, I operated again as an employee.\nThis always provided a certain level of comfort and safety. Back then, I was a bit less confident in myself. I didn't have the same experiences. I didn't have the same knowledge. I didn't have such an incredible network of friends and organizational contacts.\nOver the past year, my partner has been learning how to run the books for a small business, and I've been learning with him. We've found ourselves fascinated the process, and eager to learn about it first hand.\nDuring my initial conversations with possible new opportunities after PingCAP, we started to talk. What if I made a consultancy? What if we could experience the process of doing the books for a sole proprietorship?\nAfter preliminary contract discussions with the folks at Timber, I decided I wanted to do it. Timber would be my first contract, and I'd spend a small part of my time cooperating with non-profits I consider impactful, at a very reduced rate.\nAfter discussing with some contacts who knew more than me, and investigating the CRA Information Technology Guidelines page, I ended up visiting the surprisingly amazing and really honestly incredible BC Onestop site which helped me complete the entire process in about 5 hours and under $150 CAD. It just took months of planning and talking to folks to figure out where to go, and which buttons to push when.\nMy company Hoverbear Consulting, began operating on Tuesday and I couldn't be happier! Shortly after, I signed my first contract with the company Timber. Over the next couple months I'll be trying to find my second, non-profit, organizational engagement, and I'm looking right here on Vancouver Island!\nIf you're a non-profit or not-for-profit in the area and interested working with me a few hours a month, I invite you to visit consulting page of this site. \nI have a lot to learn in this space, and I'd love to get any constructive feedback you have. At this time, I'm not looking to overstretch myself, so I won't be looking additional contracts from for-profit organizations.\nYou can find a rough plan of my business goals on the consulting page.\nCutting to the heart of logging\n\n        Chopped Timber&nbsp;- @scutal\n        \n    \nI'm really excited to start working on Vector! It solves such a common problem that plagues infrastructure large and small.\nVector isn't trying to reinvent the world, it's not trying to eliminate existing services in your infrastructure, and it's not trying to push an agenda on you. It gives you the power to connect, manipulate, structure, split, and merge various parts of your observability pipelines.\nOver the past few days I've been having a lot of discussions with the team about their vision for the project and how I can best help them get there. So far it's been a nice change of pace to move from a specialized service like TiKV to a sort of 'swiss-army-glue' between various pieces of infrastructure like Vector.\nSo what kinds of things will I be helping Timber and Vector achieve? To start, we've been discussing how I can assist them with the road to 1.0, packaging, testing, documentation, new features, and their various technical processes. I'll also be contributing to their technical content, articles which will eventually reflect back here. Best of all, I'll be a proud member of the Vector community, working to give folks the best experience possible when contributing to Vector.\nI'm going to be posting more in the future about all sorts of silly and serious things you can do with Vector.

By default this package installs the configuration directories to /etc/dacs with root:root permissions.\ndacsgroup=root\ndacs=/etc/dacs\nfeds=$dacs/federations\nla=$feds/dacstest.dss.ca/LA\ninstall -c -g $dacsgroup -m 0640 $feds/site.conf-std $feds.site.conf\ninstall -c -g $dacsgroup -m 0660 /dev/null $feds/dacs.conf\ninstall -d -g $dacsgroup -m 0770 $feds/dacstest.dss.ca\ninstall -d -g $dacsgroup -m 0770 $la\ninstall -d -g $dacsgroup -m 0770 $la/acls\ninstall -c -g $dacsgroup -m 6660 /dev/null $la/acls/revocations\ninstall -d -g $dacsgroup -m 0770 $la/groups $la/groups/LA $la/groups/DACS\ninstall -c -g $dacsgroup -m 0660 /dev/null $la/groups/DACS/jurisdictions.grp\n\nIn the $la/groups/DACS/jurisdictions.grp:\n&lt;groups xmlns=\"http://dss.ca/dacs/v1.4\"&gt;\n &lt;group_definition jurisdiction=\"LA\" name=\"jurisdictions\"\n     mod_date=\"Tue, 14-Jun-2005 16:06:00 GMT\" type=\"public\"&gt;\n   &lt;group_member jurisdiction=\"LA\" name=\"LA Jurisdiction\" type=\"meta\"\n     alt_name=\"Test Jurisdiction for the LA Dodgers\"\n     dacs_url=\"http://dodgers.dacstest.dss.ca:18123/cgi-bin/dacs\"\n     authenticates=\"yes\" prompts=\"no\"/&gt;\n &lt;/group_definition&gt;\n&lt;/groups&gt;\n\nIn $feds/dacs.conf:\n&lt;Configuration xmlns=\"http://dss.ca/dacs/v1.4\"&gt;\n\n &lt;Default&gt;\n   FEDERATION_DOMAIN \"dacstest.dss.ca\"\n   FEDERATION_NAME \"DACSTEST\"\n   LOG_LEVEL \"info\"\n &lt;/Default&gt;\n\n &lt;Jurisdiction uri=\"dodgers.dacstest.dss.ca\"&gt;\n   JURISDICTION_NAME \"LA\"\n &lt;/Jurisdiction&gt;\n\n&lt;/Configuration&gt;\n\nThen set the configuration:\nrm -f $la/dacs.conf\nln -s $feds/dacs.conf $la/dacs.conf\n\nNext we can check the configuration with:\ndacsconf -uj LA -q\n\nIt should output a set of variables like so:\n…\nALLOW_HTTP_COOKIE \"no\"\nAUTH_FAIL_DELAY_SECS \"2\"\nACS_ERROR_HANDLER \"* /handlers/acs_failed.html\"\nSECURE_MODE \"on\"\nCOOKIE_PATH \"/\"\n…\n\nNext, we need to set up the federation keys.\ninstall -c -g $dacsgroup -m 0640 /dev/null $feds/dacstest.dss.ca/federation_keyfile\ndacskey -uj LA -q $feds/dacstest.dss.ca/federation_keyfile\nDACS Authentication\n\nIf you're following along with me, these commands may require sudo because of how we set up permissions.\n\nFirst, lets add a passwd file. The identities managed by this file are not related to the local UNIX users.\ninstall -c -g $dacsgroup -m 0660 /dev/null $la/passwd\ndacspasswd -uj LA -q -a bear\n# Give them password `bear`\n\nThen add to the Jurisdiction section of $la/dacs.conf:\n&lt;Auth id=\"passwd\"&gt;\n   URL \"http://dodgers.dacstest.dss.ca:18123/cgi-bin/dacs/local_passwd_authenticate\"\n   STYLE \"pass\"\n   CONTROL \"sufficient\"\n&lt;/Auth&gt;\n\nNow try authenticating with:\ndacsauth -m passwd passwd required -vfs \"[passwds]dacs-kwv-fs:/etc/dacs/federations/dacstest.dss.ca/LA/passwd\" -q -u bear -p bear\necho $?\n# 0 means success.\n\nNow lets make it fail:\ndacsauth -m passwd passwd required -vfs \"[passwds]dacs-kwv-fs:/etc/dacs/federations/dacstest.dss.ca/LA/passwd\" -q -u bear -p bears\necho $?\n# 1 means failure.\n\n\nThe -vfs flag is important, it tells DACS where to look for the respective files.\n\nAuthenticating as a UNIX user:\nuseradd bear\npasswd bear # Set it to foo\ndacsauth -m unix passwd required -u bear -p foo\necho $? # 0 means success.\ndacsauth -m unix passwd required -u bear -p bar\necho $? # 1 means failure.\nDACS Roles\nIf authenticating as a UNIX user, roles in DACS are based upon the groups the user is in. For example:\ndacsauth -r unix -u bear\n# Outputs 'bear'\n\ngpasswd -a users bear\n\ndacsauth -r unix -u bear\n# Outputs 'bear,users'\n\nTo add roles to a DACS user, we can consult the relevant documentation which directs us to create a /etc/dacs/federations/roles file with contents like the following:\nbear:animals,mammals\n\nNow we can check DACS for the roles of our user:\ndacsauth -r roles -vfs \"[roles]dacs-kwv-fs:/etc/dacs/federations/roles\" -u bear\n# animals,mammals\n\nYou may notice other output when issuing these commands, but note they are on stderr, not stdout.\nInterfacing with DACS\nSince we've explored two common use cases for DACS, authentication and role checking. Lets look like how doing this would look from two languages, Javascript (Node) and Rust.\nAuthentication\nIn Javascript, it's easy to just use the child_process built-in library. These examples are structured such that they would fit nicely into a middleware based system like used in express:\n/**\n * Uses DACS' local module.\n * Determines whether the login details are valid.\n * @param  {String}   user The username string.\n * @param  {String}   pass The password string.\n * @param  {Function} next The callback, signature (error, worked).\n */\nfunction localAuth(user, pass, next) {\n    var exec = require('child_process').exec,\n        module_opts = '-m passwd passwd required',\n        vfs_opts = '-vfs \"[passwds]dacs-kwv-fs:/etc/dacs/federations/dacstest.dss.ca/LA/passwd\"',\n        login_opts = '-u ' + user + ' -p ' + pass,\n        command = ['dacsauth', module_opts, vfs_opts, login_opts].join(' ');\n\n    var dacsauth = exec(command, function (err, stdout, stderr) {\n        if (err !== null) {\n            // The status code is not 0.\n            next(err, false);\n        } else {\n            next(null, true);\n        }\n    });\n}\n\n(function testLocalAuth() {\n    localAuth('bear', 'bear', function output(err, worked) {\n        if (worked) {\n            console.log('LOCAL: Successfully authenticated as `bear`');\n        } else {\n            console.log('LOCAL: Failed to authenticate');\n            console.error(err);\n        }\n    });\n}());\n\n/**\n * Uses the `unix` module.\n * Determines whether the login details are valid.\n * @param  {String}   user The username string.\n * @param  {String}   pass The password string.\n * @param  {Function} next The callback, signature (error, worked).\n */\nfunction unixAuth(user, pass, next) {\n    var exec = require('child_process').exec,\n        module_opts = '-m unix passwd required',\n        login_opts = '-u ' + user + ' -p ' + pass,\n        command = ['dacsauth', module_opts, login_opts].join(' ');\n\n    var dacsauth = exec(command, function (err, stdout, stderr) {\n        if (err !== null) {\n            // The status code is not 0.\n            next(err, false);\n        } else {\n            next(null, true);\n        }\n    });\n}\n\n(function testUnixAuth() {\n    unixAuth('bear', 'foo', function output(err, worked) {\n        if (worked) {\n            console.log('UNIX: Successfully authenticated as `bear`');\n        } else {\n            console.log('UNIX: Failed to authenticate');\n            console.error(err);\n        }\n    });\n}());\n\nRunning it:\nnode test.js\n# LOCAL: Successfully authenticated as `bear`\n# UNIX: Successfully authenticated as `bear`\n\nIn Rust, this task is also simple enough by using Command, which I've written about here (Note it is slightly out of date):\nuse std::io::Command;\nuse std::io::process::ProcessExit::ExitStatus;\n\n/// Uses DACS' local module.\n/// Determines whether the login details are valid.\nfn local_auth(user: &amp;str, pass: &amp;str) -&gt;

It is flexible with where it's configuration is stored, how it is invoked, and which components it is compiled with.\nWhen I was first compiling this article, I attempted to compile DACS from source (as suggested in both the Install and Quick Install guides). I was concerned with the fact that the guide suggests you do things like compile your own versions of things like OpenSSL and Apache from source instead of from your distributions packages. OpenSSL and Apache are both critical packages for a server, and should be handled with care. Recall things like Shellshock (which effected Apache's CGI) and Heartbleed (which effected OpenSSL and prompted the creation of LibreSSL). I ended up using the packages available on Ubuntu as the Debian packages were quite out of date in stable.\nThe DACS documentation is quite complete and covers a wide range of topics, which makes sense given DACS's wide scope. For a newcomer to DACS, however, they are quite opaque due to their self referencing and assumption of inherant knowledge regarding the application. Questions like \"Where is the normal place to store a roles file?\" and \"What are the various [foo] fields for the -vfs flag?\" were challenging to find answers to. This is understandable for a complex system that has limited usage, but at some points it felt like th documentation was written by DACS programmers, for DACS programmers, instead of DACS users.\nFurther Exploration\nDACS has a variety of features, such Apache integration (for CGI applications), Federation support, Groups, adapters for LDAP, etc.  I haven't dug into them here because they're more involved and will only be applicable in more complex scenarios, in which case, the implementor should become familiar with the documentation of DACS itself, rather then a whirlwind tour like this article.\nDACS Documentation\n\ndacsauth\nInstalling DACS (Note this is from source)\nDACS VFS\n\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/first-look-at-dacs/","title":"A First Look at DACS"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/gathering-our-voices-2013/":{"body":"I helped plan and host the 11th Gathering Our Voices Aboriginal Youth Conference in Penticton, British Columbia. Much of my time was spent learning proper software design and refining the management and registration software I developed. This was my first 'real' software project.\n\n        The registration site.\n        \n    \nI developed Gathering Our Voice's custom conference management software using Mongoose (A MongoDB ODM), MongoDB, Node.JS, Bootstrap, and Redis. The software was deployed to Heroku. The implementation language was CoffeeScript.\n\nThe event attracted over 1700 participants, the largest ever at the time.\n\nNot only did I produce and provide support for the registration site, I also acted as an ongoing member of the conference organization team, providing technical support both in-office and on-site over the course of the planning and event.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/gathering-our-voices-2013/","title":"Gathering Our Voices 2013"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/gathering-our-voices-2014/":{"body":"I played dual roles for Gathering Our Voices 2014. One role was with the B.C. Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres, and the other was with Science Venture.\nThe purpose of these conferences is to unite youth from throughout the country in learning, healing and sharing and to provide tangible experiences of tools, resources and knowledge that the youth can bring back to their communities.\nThe conference had 1800 delegates and over 2000 participants.\nBCAAFC\nWith the Association, I played both a technical and organizational role.\n\n        The GOV 2014 Site\n        \n    \nI rewrote the website code from the ground up. It was redesigned to be much more robust and speedy. The architecture itself didn't change much, but everything was refined and made cleaner. While there were some bugs, as with any software, I was able to maintain a very quick turn around as they arose.\nIn one case we discovered a bug (due to load) on a particular database action that was inproperly ordered. In MongoDB 'transactions' don't really exist, and lead to several attendees being only partially registered for workshops. It was resolved without major issue. The patch was developed, tested, and deployed within 6 hours of reporting (even though I wasn't working at the Association that day, and it was after hours), and affected delegates were resolved within the next day. I felt horrible, but it's a lesson learned.\n\n        Workshop Selection\n        \n    \nI worked with Geoff Howe to organize photography for the event, helped coordinate registration and workshop organization, and provided technical support both on-site and in-office to the team during the entire planning of, and time of, the event.\n\n        Opening Ceremonies.\n        \n    \nActing with the Association I also hosted a workshop, taking 20 delegates on a trip to Science World on the Vancouver Skytrain. It was a 3 hour workshop and delegates were able to inquire into what interested them.\nScience Venture\nWith Science Venture, I helped deliver two different workshops, both occuring twice. Workshops had approximately 25 participants each and lasted 1.5 hours.\nThe workshops were facilitated by Melisa Yestrau, Laura Bowman(?), and I. We had a great time and learnt many things ourselves.\n\n        Me.\n        \n    \nThis project was supported in part by LE,NONET.

To start the day, we went to the Civic Centre and unloaded most of our supplies (the bags pictured above included), we had the help of our great volunteers and finished well over an hour ahead of schedule!\nIn the afternoon the rest of the BCAAFC staff arrived. After giving them time to settle we all met at the Civic Centre and had a run through of the next few days. In particular, welcome day, since the first time delegates meet you sets the tone for the whole conference.\n\n        Team Run-through\n        \n    \nAfter, we took a driving tour of all of our venues. In this process we realized some of our maps were a bit less useful than we hoped. We spent some of the night fixing them.\n\nThe week before the conference UNBC, one of our major venues, went on strike. We had to find 5 new venues and integrate them in the last days before the conference. This was no small effort by all of the GOV team!\n\n\n        Map\n        \n    \nTo end the night, we gathered at the PGNFC for a special pre-GOV feast where we enjoyed a performance by their youth drum group!\n\n        Drumming\n        \n    \nTuesday: Welcome &amp; Opening Ceremonies\nPossibly the biggest benefit of the online system we developed was that groups could register entirely online. This is a stark contrast to pre-2013 when Registration Day was a very long day. Now, in 2015, it's a day of greeting, welcome, and organization. After all, by the end of the day the Opening Ceremonies would occur, and all these seats would be filled:\n\n        Civic Centre... Empty\n        \n    \nEven with a stable, well thought out plan for welcome it can take some work to hit the ground running. We were ready.\n\n        Della on the Phone\n        \n    \nI spent most of the day working with delegates who wished to select more or new workshops. Delegates were, of course, able to modify their schedules over the course of the day on their own via mobiles or computers.\n\n        Registration System\n        \n    \nIt was great to see faces both old and new.

Perhaps my favorite was the Running Wolves Drum Group of the Victoria native Friendship Centre.\n\n        Running Wolves\n        \n    \nOver the course of the conference some of the participants worked with the Unified Aboriginal Youth Collective to carve a gift for the host Friendship Centre.

In this post, we'll explore what it is, what it can do, and why it matters. First things first: What is MIO?\n\nMIO is a lightweight IO library for Rust with a focus on adding as little overhead as possible over the OS abstractions.\n\n\nNow you're probably thinking... \"So what? We have plenty of shiny stuff in the new std::io...\" and you're right! But hold off on judgement until you read this:\n\nFeatures\n\nEvent loop backed by epoll, kqueue.\nZero allocations at runtime\nNon-blocking TCP, UDP and Unix domain sockets\nHigh performance timer system\nThread safe message channel for cross thread communication\n\n\nOkay, here it's starting to get interesting. epoll, and kqueue are event notification interfaces available in Linux, and the BSDs (Darwin included). Zero allocations are great for performance, and non-blocking sockets are insanely useful for network applications.\nFor a Raft context, the ability to use evented timers is applicable for heartbeats and election timings.\nIf you've used node.js, io.js, or Python's Twisted framework event loops might be familiar to you. Yes I know callback hell sucks! Fear not, this is Rust, not some scruffy loosely-typed, garbage-collected, non-blocking language!\nThe General Idea\nMIO works off this general concept:\n\nMake a thread for the EventLoop.\nRegister interest with IOHandles.\nSupply the loop with a Handler.\nRun your code.\n\nHello, World\nThe following program is a nice, simple example of what MIO looks like:\nextern crate mio;\nuse mio::*;\nuse std::fmt::Debug;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Create an event loop\n    let mut event_loop = EventLoop::&lt;(), String&gt;::new().unwrap();\n    let sender = event_loop.channel();\n    sender.send(\"Hello\".to_string()).unwrap();\n    // Start it\n    event_loop.run(&amp;mut BearHandler).unwrap();\n}\n\nstruct BearHandler;\n\nimpl&lt;T, M: Send + Debug&gt; Handler&lt;T, M&gt; for BearHandler {\n    /// A message has been delivered\n    fn notify(&amp;mut self, _reactor: &amp;mut EventLoop&lt;T, M&gt;, msg: M) {\n        println!(\"{:?}\", msg);\n    }\n}\n\nA lot is going on here. Let's take a closer look.\nEventLoop::&lt;(), String&gt;::new();\n\nThis creates a new EventLoop. The Event loop uses T tokens of type (), and channels that consume and pass M: Send of type String. You can use anything that implements Send for messages.\nevent_loop.channel();\n\nThis gives us a channel to send Strings. When we send() later our BearHandler wakes up and invokes notify.\nFrom there, notify prints out the message. In a real application, this is where your business logic would be to determine what to do with the message.\nGetting a Handle(r)\nA Handler can implement some or all of the following functions:\npub trait Handler&lt;T: Token, M: Send&gt; {\n    /// A registered IoHandle has available data to read\n    fn readable(&amp;mut self, reactor: &amp;mut EventLoop&lt;T, M&gt;, hint: ReadHint, token: T);\n    /// A registered IoHandle is available to write to\n    fn writable(&amp;mut self, reactor: &amp;mut EventLoop&lt;T, M&gt;, token: T);\n    /// A registered timer has expired\n    fn timeout(&amp;mut self, reactor: &amp;mut EventLoop&lt;T, M&gt;, token: T);\n    /// A message has been delivered\n    fn notify(&amp;mut self, reactor: &amp;mut EventLoop&lt;T, M&gt;, msg: M);\n    /// A signal has been delivered to the process\n    fn signal(&amp;mut self, reactor: &amp;mut EventLoop&lt;T, M&gt;, info: mio::SigInfo);\n}\n\nSo this is a lot more then just sending some Strings around! Did you doubt me?\nWhat's really cool is your Handler can have a data backing since it's just a trait that you can implement yourself! Let's do that now:\nextern crate mio;\nuse mio::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Create an event loop\n    let mut event_loop = EventLoop::&lt;(), u64&gt;::new().unwrap();\n    let sender = event_loop.channel();\n    for i in 0.. 5 {\n        sender.send(i).unwrap();\n    }\n    // Start it\n    event_loop.run(&amp;mut BearHandler(0)).unwrap();\n}\n\nstruct BearHandler(u64);\n\nimpl&lt;T&gt; Handler&lt;T, u64&gt; for BearHandler {\n    fn notify(&amp;mut self, _reactor: &amp;mut EventLoop&lt;T, u64&gt;, msg: u64) {\n        self.0 += msg;\n        println!(\"Message: {}, Total: {}\", msg, self.0);\n    }\n}\n\nOutput:\nMessage: 0, Total: 0\nMessage: 1, Total: 1\nMessage: 2, Total: 3\nMessage: 3, Total: 6\nMessage: 4, Total: 10\n\nIn this case, our BearHandler was a humble u64 tuple which we mutated, but you could easily make this a more complicated struct.\nRegistered Interest\nJust sending messages isn't particularly interesting, let's wire up some new interests.\nAlright, so let's take our humble little BearHandler and build it into a bit of a state mutation game:\n\nEach time a timer fire (every 250ms) send a UDP packet to some socket.\nEach time that socket gets hit decrement a count by 1.\nEach time on the channel increment it by that much.\n\nFirst, we'll modify the BearHandler to reflect these changes. First, we'll make it a proper struct and let it store a pair of sockets as well as it's count.\nSecond, we'll implement the readable, timeout, and notify. Note in the readable we take care to drain the socket. Also, note how the timeout doesn't need to reset itself, we can clear it with clear_timeout if we want.\nimpl Handler&lt;Token, u64&gt; for BearHandler {\n    fn readable(&amp;mut self, _reactor: &amp;mut EventLoop&lt;Token, u64&gt;, _token: Token, _hint: ReadHint) {\n        let mut buffer = buf::RingBuf::new(1024);\n        // Drain socket, otherwise infinite loop!\n        net::TryRecv::recv_from(&amp;self.listener, &amp;mut buffer.writer()).unwrap();\n        self.count -= 1;\n        println!(\"Decremented, Total: {}\", self.count);\n    }\n    fn timeout(&amp;mut self, reactor: &amp;mut EventLoop&lt;Token, u64&gt;, _token: Token) {\n        self.sender.send_to(&amp;[0], \"127.0.0.1:12345\").unwrap();\n        // Reset\n        reactor.timeout(TIMEOUT, Duration::milliseconds(250)).unwrap();\n        println!(\"Timeout\");\n    }\n\n    fn notify(&amp;mut self, _reactor: &amp;mut EventLoop&lt;Token, u64&gt;, msg: u64) {\n        self.count += msg;\n        println!(\"Increment by: {}, Total: {}\", msg, self.count);\n    }\n}\n\nNext, registering the various events, we'll use some of MIO's mio::net items:\nconst LISTENER: Token = Token(0);\nconst TIMEOUT:  Token = Token(1);\nfn main() {\n    // Create an event loop\n    let mut event_loop = EventLoop::&lt;Token, u64&gt;::new().unwrap();\n    // Register Interest\n    let listener = UdpSocket::bind(\"127.0.0.1:12345\").unwrap();\n    event_loop.register(&amp;listener, LISTENER).unwrap(); // Token lets us distinguish.\n    // Increments\n    let incrementer = event_loop.channel();\n    for i in 0.. 5 {\n        incrementer.send(i).unwrap();\n    }\n    // Decrements\n    event_loop.timeout(TIMEOUT, Duration::milliseconds(250)).unwrap();\n    // Start it\n    let sender = UdpSocket::bind(\"127.0.0.1:12346\").unwrap();\n    event_loop.run(&amp;mut BearHandler {\n        count: 0,\n        listener: listener,\n        sender: sender\n    }).unwrap();\n}\n\nOutput:\nIncrement by: 0, Total: 0\nIncrement by: 1, Total: 1\nIncrement by: 2, Total: 3\nIncrement by: 3, Total: 6\nIncrement by: 4, Total: 10\nTimeout\nDecremented, Total: 9\nTimeout\nDecremented, Total: 8\nTimeout\nDecremented, Total: 7\nTimeout\nDecremented, Total: 6\nTimeout\nDecremented, Total: 5\nTimeout\nDecremented, Total: 4\nTimeout\nDecremented, Total: 3\nTimeout\nDecremented, Total: 2\nTimeout\nDecremented, Total: 1\nTimeout\nDecremented, Total: 0\n\n\nBy the way, in our examples MIO will take over the main thread and block. In a normal application you'll want to kick it off into a new thread when you start() it.\n\nLearn More\n\nI found Wycats' mio-book repo very useful.\nAs always, the docs were a great help.\nThis post is discussed on Reddit.\nThis post is also discussed on Hacker News!\n\nHelp Out!\nWe're tracking progress on integrating MIO into Raft with this issue.

The feature has existed for some time, but recently has it become much more usable for everyday Linux development work.\nIn this post, we'll investigate some ways to get the most out of WSL. I won't present anything new here, just providing a single place for how I or someone else could get things set up.\n\n\nThis guide was written on Windows 10 Pro, Insiders build 18985, targetting Ubuntu. Your mileage may vary on older/newer builds or different distros.\n\nGetting it set up\nGetting WSL set up has a few steps, first you'll need to add some Windows optional Features.\n# In an administrator powershell\nEnable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName \"Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux\"\nEnable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName \"VirtualMachinePlatform\" \nwsl --set-default-version 2\n\nNext, head on over to the Windows Store and install 'Ubuntu'. Once it's downloaded you should launch it and do the first time setup. It'll ask you to put a username and password.\nAt the point, you have a WSL2 installation of Ubuntu. To verify:\n$ wsl -l -v\n  NAME      STATE           VERSION\n* Ubuntu    Running         2\n\nTo access Ubuntu type wsl from Powershell, or open the 'Ubuntu' app in your Start Menu.\nUpdating Ubuntu\nThe Ubuntu version you should have is Ubuntu 18.04. (Check with lsb_release -r) In order to upgrade it to Ubuntu 19.04 \nwsl sudo sed -i 's/Prompt=lts/Prompt=normal/g' /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades\nwsl sudo do-release-upgrade\n\nIf the process asks you about \"restart services during package upgrades without asking\" you should pick no! If it asks you for a list of services to restart, just have it empty.\n\nOur Ubuntu isn't running systemd (yet) so we don't have to restart the services.\n\nIf the process asks you about lxd and the snap store, you can select skip. Since we're not running lxd and snapd (yet) we don't need it.\nFor any new configuration files (such as sshd) select install the package maintainer's version.\nThen, let it 'restart', restart the WSL machine with wsl --shutdown from a Powershell.\nOpen up a Ubuntu shell and check lsb_release -r again. For me it says 19.04. This means I need to upgrade again to get to 19.10!\nwsl sudo do-release-upgrade\n\nFollowing the same procedure, lsb_release -r for me now shows 19.10.\nBetter terminals\nThe 'Windows Terminal' app provides a nicer terminal experience.\n\n        Windows Terminal chooser\n        \n    \nYou can also install VS Code Insiders and the Remote - WSL extension to get a full featured editor/explorer.\n\n        VS Code chooser\n        \n    \nOccasionally VS Code, the extension, or something else will update and render it unable to connect. Opening a local VS Code window, closing it, then restarting the computer should fix it.\nConfiguring WSL\nTypically, you won't want your WSL instance to be able to consume all your resources. You may also want to disable things like swap.\nSave a file to %UserProfile%/.wslconfig with contents like the following:\n[wsl2]\nmemory=12GB\nswap=0\n\nTo apply these changes, run wsl --shutdown and open up a new Ubuntu terminal.\nPasswordless sudo\nHaving to deal with passwords in a dev VM is kind of annoying. Let's turn that off in Ubuntu:\ncat &lt;&lt;-'EOF' | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/sudo\n%sudo         ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\nEOF\nSet up SSH keys\nIf you've already rolled keys with Window's built-in ssh-keygen you should copy over your existing key.\nIn your Ubuntu shell (change your user if it's different between Windows and Linux):\nmkdir -p ~/.ssh\ncp -r /mnt/c/Users/$USER/.ssh/* ~/.ssh/\nchmod -R o-rwx,g-rwx ~/.ssh/*\n\nIf you haven't already, roll some keys in Linux and copy them the other way:\nmkdir -p /mnt/c/Users/$USER/.ssh/\ncp -r ~/.ssh/* /mnt/c/Users/$USER/.ssh/\n\nUnfortunately we can't easily link them since they're on different devices.\nGet systemd functional\nAt this stage of WSL2's development, we don't get a true systemd yet. That is, by default, you can't do things like systemctl start sshd or systemctl start docker.\nThankfully, a wonderful person in the Snapcraft project, Daniel, got an amazingly convienent hack working! While you may want to fully review the linked article, here's a quick and dirty breakdown.\nIn your Ubuntu shell:\n\nUbuntu 20.20?

Look here.\n\nThe project was a really interesting learning experience about how Heroku does things, on bash scripting, and about multirust, which I'd not used before but now am quite a fan of! (I previously just rustup'd the newest nightly every few days.)\nFeatures\n\nCached multirust, Rust toolchain.\nCaching of previous build artifacts to (potentially dramatically) speed up similar builds.\nConfigurable version selection inside of the Cargo.toml.\n\nIt's unit tested using Heroku's official testrunner every commit (using homu) and includes a Makefile which executes a docker based test locally.\nDevelopment Story\nI am a huge fan of Heroku, they're were I hosted my first web app, they are where Gathering Our Voices hosted our website for two years, and I have several friends who work there. While I was in San Fransisco for our raft-rs meetup they even invited me to come visit and meet some of their team.\nThere was, however, one sore point with Heroku for me: There were no Rust buildpacks I was happy with! There was emk's and chrisumbel's but I wasn't particularly happy with either. There wasn't a ton of flexibility with them and they were both only manually tested with vagrant VMs. The last update to either was in March, which was still around the time when Rust was rapidly changing and maturing. (Though, it still is, but more conservatively!)\nOriginally my plan had been to issue a PR to one of them, but by the time I started digging into how things worked I realized I wanted to make my own buildpack. So I did. At first I used rustup and tried to handle detecting when to update myself, but eventually realized multirust was a more straightforward way to go.\nI made the mistake of starting it right before both exams and the holidays, so things went slower than I anticipated. Along the way I got to learn several neat lessons which I've shared below. I'm looking forward to playing more with Rust on Heroku and would some day like to see raft-rs based applications on their infrastructure.\n\nA special thanks to my friends at Heroku, Peter and Joe, for helping me work out a few kinks and showing me the test-runner (which showed me the cedar docker images as well!)\n\nLessons Learned\n\n\nRust has no posted version strings for nightly and beta, unlike stable which you can get the current versions with curl https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/channel-rust-stable, you cannot use a similar method to detect for beta and nightly. While I was using rustup at one point I resorted to using curl -s https://doc.rust-lang.org/$RUSTC_CHANNEL/index.html | grep -hE \"class=\\\"hash\" | grep -ohE \"\\w{9}\" to detect the version! I didn't like that, it was dirty.\n\n\nHeroku doesn't let buildpacks do anything more than applications really. Really, thinking about it, this makes sense, but I was initially really surprised that I couldn't (easily) use tools like apt-get to fetch packages.\n\n\ngrep's options are vaster in number than I first realized. I love grep and use it with regexs all the time, but in my exploration I actually found some really interesting flags, including one that nulls out newlines for multiline matching. Crazy stuff!\n\n\nmultirust doesn't seem to allow you to configure where it puts the .multirust directory. While I tried several promising sounding flags (--prefix, --destdir) I didn't find anything of the sort. I ended up just setting $HOME myself, but I don't think this is the best idea.\n\n\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/heroku-rust-buildpack/","title":"A Rust Heroku Buildpack"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/init-configuration/":{"body":"An initialization system's main interface with the user is through it's configuration scripts and service files. Let's take a look at what this looks like for systemd and OpenRC.\nWith systemd, daemon configuration is handled by .toml configuration files. With OpenRC, this task is performed by shell scripts.\nDaemons and services\nsystemd stores service files in /etc/systemd/system/ (user-provided) or /usr/lib/systemd/system/ (package-provided). .service files are used to declare configuration.\nOpenRC stores scripts in /etc/init.d/, the scripts are typically standalone, configuration does not require multiple separate files.\nHere is the contents of /etc/systemd/system/sshd.service on a Fedora 20 system:\n[Unit]\nDescription=OpenSSH server daemon\nAfter=syslog.target network.target auditd.service\n\n[Service]\nEnvironmentFile=/etc/sysconfig/sshd\nExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/sshd-keygen\nExecStart=/usr/sbin/sshd -D $OPTIONS\nExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID\nKillMode=process\nRestart=on-failure\nRestartSec=42s\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nFor comparison, this is an excerpt of /etc/init.d/sshd on Funtoo Linux, not the entire file:\ndepend() {\n  use logger dns\n  if [ \"${rc_need+set}\" = \"set\" ]; then\n    : # Do nothing, the user has explicitly set rc_need\n  else\n    warn_addr=''\n    for x in $(awk '/^ListenAddress/{ print $2 }' \"$SSHD_CONFIG\" 2&gt;/dev/null) ; do\n      case \"$x\" in\n        0.0.0.0|0.0.0.0:*) ;;\n        ::|\\[::\\]*) ;;\n        *) warn_addr=\"${warn_addr} $x\" ;;\n      esac\n    done\n    unset x\n    if [ \"${warn_addr:+set}\" = \"set\" ]; then\n      need net\n      ewarn \"You are binding an interface in ListenAddress statement in your sshd_config!\"\n      ewarn \"You must add rc_need=\\\"net.FOO\\\" to your /etc/conf.d/sshd\"\n      ewarn \"where FOO is the interface(s) providing the following address(es):\"\n      ewarn \"${warn_addr}\"\n    fi\n    unset warn_addr\n  fi\n}\n\nstart() {\n  checkconfig || return 1\n\n  ebegin \"Starting ${SVCNAME}\"\n  start-stop-daemon --start --exec \"${SSHD_BINARY}\" \\\n      --pidfile \"${SSHD_PIDFILE}\" \\\n      -- ${SSHD_OPTS}\n  eend $?\n}\n\nstop() {\n  if [ \"${RC_CMD}\" = \"restart\" ] ; then\n    checkconfig || return 1\n  fi\n\n  ebegin \"Stopping ${SVCNAME}\"\n  start-stop-daemon --stop --exec \"${SSHD_BINARY}\" \\\n      --pidfile \"${SSHD_PIDFILE}\" --quiet\n  eend $?\n}\n\nAn important distinction to note is that while systemd's configuration is declarative, OpenRC's configuration is programmatic. The decision to use a declarative method was explained in this article under the \"Keeping the First User PID Small\" heading.\n\nShell is fast and shell is slow. It is fast to hack, but slow in execution. The classic sysvinit boot logic is modelled around shell scripts.\n\nOne of systemd's main goals, at least in regards to services, is to start them fast, and for this reason they are willing to sacrifice some flexibility. Due to successful deployments of systemd in Arch Linux and Fedora (among others), this idea has been proven feasible.\nFor many services, a full blown shell script is not necessary. For example, with OpenRC's sshd script the start and stop jobs really only check the configuration of the service (checkconfig is defined elsewhere in the file) and then invoke start-stop-daemon. It's possible to simply call a shell script from a systemd service, but this forces the use of multiple files, and results in a loss of the speed gained from not utilizing the shell.\nDependencies\nIn systemd dependencies are handled via the declarations Wants, Requires, and After in the [Unit] section of the .service. For more info visit Arch Linux's SystemD Dependencies Section. For example:\n/etc/systemd/system/A.service\n[Unit]\n# Optionally depends on `C` and `D`.\nWants=C.service D.service\n# Start after `D`, but concurrently with `C`\nAfter=D.service\n\n/etc/systemd/system/B.service\n[Unit]\n# Strictly depend on A and Networking.\nRequires=A.service Networking.target\n# Start after `A`, but concurrently with `Networking`\nAfter=A.service\n\nIt's rather fascinating that Requires and Wants do not imply After for their specified services. It does make sense though, many services do not immediately require their attached services.\nFor OpenRC, dependencies are handled by the depend function of the script. For more info visit The Funtoo OpenRC Page.\n/etc/init.d/nginx\ndepend() {\n\tneed net\n\tuse dns logger netmount\n}\n\nThere are five options:\n\nneed introduces a hard dependency (like Require)\nuse is a soft dependency which will only invoke if the depended upon service is also on the same runlevel.\nafter functions like After in system, making sure this service starts after the specified one.\nprovide can be used to allow the service to 'stand in' for another. For example, MariaDB and MySQL could both provide sql.\nkeyword allows for overrides. Check the documentation for more on this.\n\nOther files\nSystemd uses a number of extra file types. Some examples are:\n\n.wants, a folder with symlinks to services that are a needed by a target. For example, /usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target has a cooresponding folder /usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants with symlinks to service files like systemd-logind.service, and systemd-user-sessions.service on CentOS 7.\n.socket, denotes a socket activated configuration. It's possible to set up certain services in systemd to not start until their socket is activated on the system.\n.timer, denotes a timer based activation. This fulfills some of the same roles as programs like vixiecron and fcron.\n\nOpenRC allows for files in /etc/conf.d to be sourced for scripts of the same name in /etc/init.d. The advantage of this is that most scripts in /etc/init.d won't need to be modified (and thus can be updated safely). This is a collary to the Store config in the environment section of the 12factor methodology.\n\nEncourage the separation of configuration and runtime.\n\nHere we can see the origin of the ${SSHD_OPTS} from the earlier example of /etc/init.d/sshd:\n/etc/conf.d/sshd:\n# /etc/conf.d/sshd: config file for /etc/init.d/sshd\n# Where is your sshd_config file stored?\nSSHD_CONFDIR=\"/etc/ssh\"\n\n# Any random options you want to pass to sshd.\n# See the sshd(8) manpage for more info.\nSSHD_OPTS=\"\"\n\n# Pid file to use (needs to be absolute path).\n#SSHD_PIDFILE=\"/var/run/sshd.pid\"\n\n\n# Path to the sshd binary (needs to be absolute path).\n#SSHD_BINARY=\"/usr/sbin/sshd\"\nConfiguring Init Itself\nOpenRC is configured the same way as most traditional Linux/BSD services are configured. The default configuration on Funtoo is well commented and usually self-explanatory, even including gotchas in their notes. There are a few knobs to tweak based on user preferences.\n/etc/rc.conf:\n# Set to \"YES\" if you want the rc system to try and start services\n# in parallel for a slight speed improvement. When running in parallel we\n# prefix the service output with its name as the output will get\n# jumbled up.\n# WARNING: whilst we have improved parallel, it can still potentially lock\n# the boot process. Don't file bugs about this unless you can supply\n# patches that fix it without breaking other things!\nrc_parallel=\"YES\"\n\n# rc_logger launches a logging daemon to log the entire rc process to\n# /var/log/rc.log\n# NOTE: Linux systems require the devfs service to be started before\n# logging can take place and as such cannot log the sysinit runlevel.\nrc_logger=\"YES\"\n\nsystemd's configuration is similarly accessible in /etc/systemd/*.conf, from there it's possible to set things like the default CPU limits for processes and other things.\n/etc/systemd/system.conf:\n[Manager]\n#CPUAffinity=1 2\n#DefaultStandardOutput=journal\n#DefaultStandardError=inherit\n#JoinControllers=cpu,cpuacct net_cls,net_prio\n#RuntimeWatchdogSec=0\n#ShutdownWatchdogSec=10min\n#CapabilityBoundingSet=\n#TimerSlackNSec=\n#DefaultTimeoutStartSec=90s\n#DefaultTimeoutStopSec=90s\n#DefaultRestartSec=100ms\n#DefaultStartLimitInterval=10s\n#DefaultStartLimitBurst=5\n#DefaultEnvironment=\n#DefaultLimitCPU=\n#DefaultLimitFSIZE=\n#DefaultLimitDATA=\n#DefaultLimitSTACK=\n#DefaultLimitCORE=\n\njournald.conf offers configuration options on the journal, or logger.\nThoughts\nThe declarative model of systemd emulates a \"batteries included\" model. It relies on integrated, homogeneous functionality in order to gain performance boosts and an encompassing feature set. Over the past few years the project has had a growing scope in the userland, as evidenced by the existance of things like the logind.conf and journald.conf, both of which used to be jobs outside of the initialization system. The regular syntax of all of these configurations does offer a boon, but at the cost of modularity and with greater complexity.\nOpenRC's sysvinit based startup shows it's age, but the system's lack of opinionation offers huge benefits. With OpenRC, there is no persistent daemon, though integration with supervision tools like s6 and monit exist. OpenRC also plays nice with *cron. Keeping itself in a limited scope, and maintaining the \"Do one thing and do it well\" philosophy that gave rise to the UNIX ecosystem. It has worn it's age well, however it's reliance on old assumptions about the lifecycle of a system boot limits it's capabilities.\nFurther Reading\n\nOpenRC Dependencies\nRethinking PID 1\nRed Hat: Working with systemd Targets\nSystemd Target\nSystemd status update 1\nSystemd status update 2\nSystemd status update 3\nComparison of init Systems\ns6 why?\nInitscripts (Gentoo Handbook)\n\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/init-configuration/","title":"Init - Configuration"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/init-runlevels-and-targets/":{"body":"In this post, we'll look at how runlevels work in two major init systems, systemd and OpenRC. If you're interested in trying out systemd, I'd suggest using an Arch Linux Live ISO. For those interested in trying OpenRC, check out Funtoo. Both of these will work great in your favorite virtualization solution.\nOpenRC\nOpenRC uses runlevels in very much the same way as sysvinit (or BSD init). At any given time the system is in one of the defined runlevels, there are three internal runlevels and four user defined runlevels.\nInternal Runlevels:\n\nsysinit: Initialize the system.\nshutdown: Power off the system.\nreboot: Rebooting the system.\n\nUser Runlevels:\n\nboot: Starts all system-necessary services for other runlevels.\ndefault: Used for day-to-day-operations\nnonetwork: Used when no network connectivity is required.\nsingle: Single-user mode.\n\nA system transitions between runlevels like so:\nsysinit -&gt; boot -&gt; default -&gt; shutdown\n\nThe services controlled by a particular runlevel are controlled by /etc/inittab and via the rc-update command.\nOn a modern Funtoo LXC Container, your runlevels  might look like this:\n± # rc-update -v\n             bootmisc | boot\n         busybox-ntpd |\n     busybox-watchdog |\n          consolefont |\n                 dbus |\n                devfs |                       sysinit\n               dhcpcd |\n                dmesg |                       sysinit\n                 fsck | boot\n           git-daemon |\n                  gpm |\n             hostname | boot\n              hwclock | boot\n             iptables |      default\n              keymaps | boot\n            killprocs |              shutdown\n    kmod-static-nodes |                       sysinit\n                local |      default\n           localmount | boot\n              modules | boot\n             mount-ro |              shutdown\n                 mtab | boot\n               murmur |\n           netif.eth0 |      default\n             netif.lo |                       sysinit\n           netif.tmpl |\n             netmount |      default\n                nginx |      default\n              numlock |\n              openvpn |      default\n              pciparm |\n              postfix |\n               procfs | boot\n            pydoc-2.7 |\n            pydoc-3.3 |\n            pydoc-3.4 |\n                redis |\n                 root | boot\n               rsyncd |\n            savecache |              shutdown\n                 sshd |      default\n                 swap | boot\n            swapfiles | boot\n              swclock |\n               sysctl | boot\n                sysfs |                       sysinit\n         termencoding | boot\n         tmpfiles.dev |                       sysinit\n       tmpfiles.setup | boot\n                 udev |                       sysinit\n           udev-mount |                       sysinit\n       udev-postmount | boot\n              urandom | boot\n\nServices can be added to runlevels with:\nrc-update add &lt;service&gt; &lt;runlevel&gt;\n\nOr removed with:\nrc-update del &lt;service&gt; &lt;runlevel&gt;\n\nChanging between runlevels is done via the rc &lt;runlevel&gt; command, but most users will never need to do this as runlevels are (mostly) managed by the system.\nIn the case where a user does want to change runlevels in this way, it is often such that they are utilizing Stacked Runlevels.\nFor example, if a user wanted to differentiate which services were running on their laptop when it was powered or on battery, they could create two separate runlevels stacked atop default. While plugged in, the laptop could be running test databases or any number of services, but after changing runlevels these services could be disabled to save on battery.\nBenefits\n\nSimple: There are (normally) only 7 runlevels, and for most of it's time the system remains on the default runlevel.\nEstablished:  init and sysvinit have been using runlevels for ages.\nSufficient: Runlevels have been shown to provide sufficient functionality for most applications.\n\nDownfalls\n\nInflexible: While there are ways to create 'Stacked Runlevels', the system is not very capable of more exotic requirements.\nAging: Modern systems, especially desktops and laptops, frequently change their hardware (inserting a USB stick), or network settings (Changing between WiFi networks), steps have been taken by system designers to handle these stumbling blocks, but it's not longer always sufficient to scan once for hardware, for example.\n\nsystemd\nsystemd uses targets instead of runlevels. Each target has a unique name, and multiple targets can be active at one time. Since most distributions using systemd have migrated from a runlevel based init system, there are targets which roughly correspond to the runlevels used by OpenRC, init, and sysvinit.\n\npoweroff: Halt the system.\nrescue: Single user mode.\nmulti-user: Multi-user, non-graphical. User-defined/Site-specific runlevels.\ngraphical: Multi-user, graphical. Usually multi-user + graphical login.\nreboot: Reboot\nemergency: Emergency Shell\n\nIt's important to understand that these are not necessarily the only active targets. In the case of the graphical target, a display manager service like kdm might be started, this target would also activate the multi-user target.\nThe multi-user target might also activate a service like dbus, and another target named basic. This is interesting because it allows us to cleanly compose and extend the system to suit our needs.\nA .target file resides in /usr/lib/systemd/system or /usr/lib/systemd/system/ and looks like this:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Graphical Interface\nDocumentation=man:systemd.special(7)\nRequires=multi-user.target\nAfter=multi-user.target\nConflicts=rescue.target\nWants=display-manager.service\nAllowIsolate=yes\n\nThis file would be accompanied by a &lt;target&gt;.wants directory containing the services it should enable.\nTargets can be controlled very similar to systemd's .service unit files, you just need to add .target at the end.\nsystemctl status graphical.target\n± % systemctl status graphical.target\ngraphical.target - Graphical Interface\nLoaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/graphical.target; enabled)\nActive: active since Thu 2014-09-25 21:21:26 PDT; 4 days ago\nDocs: man:systemd.special(7)\n\n Sep 25 21:21:26 aluminum systemd[1]: Starting Graphical Interface.\n Sep 25 21:21:26 aluminum systemd[1]: Reached target Graphical Interface.\n\nThe .target based approach allows for various services to be grouped in a logical manner.

This time, we'll take a look at how to integrate Keycloak with an Immutant app, again using Docker heavily.\n\nIf you haven't read the previous few articles, it might be useful to give them a quick glance over.\n\nKeycloak\nErecting Keycloak\nKeycloak is an integrated Single-Sign-On and Identity Management platform from the fine folks of JBoss. A Docker image of Keycloak is available here, just like Immutant, Wildfly, and a few others.\nTo pull the Keycloak image:\ndocker pull jboss/keycloak\n\nThen, to erect the container (Source):\ndocker run -it --name keycloak -p 8080:8080 -p 9090:9090 jboss/keycloak\n\n\nUse the  -d flag to daemonize the service so it doesn't die with the tty. You can check the logs later with docker logs -f keycloak\n\nFinally, you should be able to browse to http://localhost:8080/ and see the friendly Wildfly logo and welcome screen. Visiting http://localhost:8080/auth/ should yield a Keycloak welcome screen.\nGetting into Keycloak\nVisiting http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/ should bring you to a very blue login screen. The Keycloak docker image starts with a pre-created admin account for you to log in with.\nUsername: admin\nPassword: admin\nAfter logging in, Keycloak should prompt for a password change.\nCreating an Application\nBrowse to the Applications menu and hit the blue Add Application button. For this exploration, I'm creating a learning application.\nName: learning\nEnabled: ON\nAccess Type: confidential\nRedirect URI: http://localhost:8081/*\nAfter hitting save, you'll have the opportunity to add more information. For this exploration, we don't need to add any more information here.\nVisiting the Roles tab at the top, hit Add Role and create a pair of roles:\n\nuser\nadmin\n\nThere are several other tabs which contain many more interesting configuration options, but we'll leave these alone for now.\nCreating Some Users\nIn our exploration, we'll utilize both of the scopes above to see how to allow different roles to access different parts of the site.\nBrowse over to the Users menu. Beside the search box, hit View all Users. You should see admin already created. Create a user user, the rest of the information you can use anything, or nothing.\nGoing back to the user listing. Select the admin user and go to the Role Mappings tab. At the bottom in \"Application Roles\" select learning from the dropdown. Add the admin role for the admin user. Then, repeat the steps for the user user, but only assign them the user role, not admin.\nWhat does this all mean? The admin user should be able to access every page the admin role can. The user user should not be able to access the admin role's pages.\nImmutant\nSetting Up the Immutant Application\nStart up a new lein project with:\nlein new app learning\n\nYour learning/project.clj needs to be modified to look similar to this:\n(defproject learning \"0.1.0-SNAPSHOT\"\n  :description \"FIXME: write description\"\n  :url \"http://example.com/FIXME\"\n  :license {:name \"MPL\"\n            :url \"http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mpl-2.0/\"}\n  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure \"1.6.0\"]\n                 [org.immutant/immutant \"2.x.incremental.191\"]\n                 [compojure \"1.1.8\"]]\n  :repositories [[\"Immutant incremental builds\"\n                  \"http://downloads.immutant.org/incremental/\"]]\n  :plugins [[lein-immutant \"2.0.0-SNAPSHOT\"]]\n  :main ^:skip-aot learning.core\n  :target-path \"target/%s\"\n  :profiles {:uberjar {:aot :all}}\n  ; Plugin configuration.\n  :ring {:handler learning.core/app}\n  :immutant {\n     :war {\n        :dev? false\n        :resource-paths [\"resources\"]\n        :nrepl {\n          :port 8888\n          :start? true}}})\n\nNow change your learning/src/learning/core.clj file to contain the following:\n(ns learning.core\n  (:use compojure.core)\n  (:require [compojure.route       :as route]\n            [immutant.web          :as web]\n            [immutant.web.servlet  :as servlet])\n  (:gen-class))\n\n\n(defn get-token\n  \"Gets the session for the user\"\n  [request]\n  (let [{servlet-request :servlet-request} request\n        security-context (.getAttribute servlet-request \"org.keycloak.KeycloakSecurityContext\")\n        id-token (.getIdToken security-context)]\n    id-token))\n\n(defn show-profile\n  \"Shows the profile of the user\"\n  [request]\n  (try\n    (let [token (get-token request)]\n      ; The token is a Java Object, don't expect more then a reference.\n      (str \"&lt;p&gt;Token is: &lt;pre&gt;\" token \"&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\"\n           ; This should show the users name.\n           ; Reference: https://docs.jboss.org/keycloak/docs/1.0-beta-3/javadocs/org/keycloak/representations/IDToken.html\n           \"&lt;p&gt;User is: &lt;pre&gt;\" (.getPreferredUsername token) \"&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\"))\n    (catch Exception e\n      ; There is no token.\n      (str \"&lt;p&gt;No user found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;\" e \"&lt;/pre&gt;\"))))\n\n(defn test-handler\n  \"A very versatile test route handler\"\n  ; Handled different arities.\n  ([request base]\n   (str \"&lt;h1&gt;Base: \" base \"&lt;/h1&gt;\"\n        \"&lt;p&gt;\" (show-profile request) \"&lt;/p&gt;\"))\n  ([request base sub]\n   (str \"&lt;h1&gt;Base: \" base \" Sub: \" sub \"&lt;/h1&gt;\"\n        \"&lt;p&gt;\" (show-profile request) \"&lt;/p&gt;\"))\n  ([request base sub subsub]\n   (str \"&lt;h1&gt;Base: \" base \" Sub: \" sub \" Subsub: \" subsub \"&lt;/h1&gt;\"\n        \"&lt;p&gt;\" (show-profile request) \"&lt;/p&gt;\")))\n\n(defroutes app\n  \"The router.\"\n  ; Logout\n  ; Doesn't currently work: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-478\n  (GET \"/logout\" [:as request]\n    (let [{servlet-request :servlet-request} request]\n      (.logout servlet-request)\n      (str \"Logged out\")))\n  ; Rest of the routes.\n  (GET \"/\" [:as request]\n       (test-handler request \"/\"))\n  (GET \"/:base\" [base :as request]\n       (test-handler request base))\n  (GET \"/:base/:sub\" [base sub :as request]\n       (test-handler request base sub))\n  (GET \"/:base/:sub/:subsub\" [base sub subsub :as request]\n       (test-handler request base sub subsub))\n  (route/not-found \"&lt;h1&gt;Page not found&lt;/h1&gt;\"))\n\n(defn -main\n  \"Start the server\"\n  [&amp; args]\n  ; Start the server.\n  (web/run (servlet/create-servlet app) :port 8081))\n\nThe get-token function returns an object that you can run things like (.getPreferredUsername token). This documents the different methods you can use.\nPlanning the Routes\nThe routes are specifically very, very general so that we can test various routes. In our exploration we'll be paying attention to the following routes:\n\n/logout - Logs out the user. (Note: This is currently broken in Keycloak-1.0.0-beta-3)\n/test and /test/foo - General routes available to all visitors.\n/locked and /locked/foo - Routes available to all user and admin roles.\n/admin and /admin/foo - Routes available to only administrators.\n\nThe routes in our code above covers much, much more then those, but you can play with those on your own.\nIntegrating Keycloak\nKeycloak's User Guide specifies how to secure the application via the web.xml. If you're familiar with JBoss (I'm not) this is apparently a fairly standard way of securing the application.\nHowever, Immutant does not currently provide an easy way to modify the web.xml in the war files it builds. Thankfully, since a war is a jar, and a jar is a zip, we can just add it in after.\nFirst, lets make a folder for this type of data in /learning/resources.\nmkdir resources/WEB-INF\n\nThen, create a learning/resources/WEB-INF/web.xml with the following XML:\n&lt;web-app xmlns=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd\" version=\"3.0\"&gt;\n\t&lt;distributable/&gt;\n\t&lt;listener&gt;\n\t\t&lt;listener-class&gt;org.projectodd.wunderboss.wildfly.ServletListener&lt;/listener-class&gt;\n\t&lt;/listener&gt;\n\n\t&lt;!-- Anyone --&gt;\n\t&lt;security-constraint&gt;\n\t\t&lt;web-resource-collection&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;web-resource-name&gt;test&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;url-pattern&gt;/test&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;url-pattern&gt;/test/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;\n\t&lt;/security-constraint&gt;\n\n\t&lt;!-- Users and Admins --&gt;\n\t&lt;security-constraint&gt;\n\t\t&lt;auth-constraint&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;role-name&gt;user&lt;/role-name&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;role-name&gt;admin&lt;/role-name&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/auth-constraint&gt;\n\t\t&lt;web-resource-collection&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;web-resource-name&gt;locked&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;url-pattern&gt;/locked&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;!-- Wildcard.

Select the keycloak.json from the dropdown. Finally, Download the output and save it as learning/WEB-INF/keycloak.json.\nBuilding the container\nSince we'll be using a Docker container for the application, create a learning/Dockerfile with the following:\nFROM jboss/keycloak-adapter-wildfly\nRUN /opt/wildfly/bin/add-user.sh admin hunter2 --silent\nADD target/base+system+user+dev/learning.war /opt/wildfly/standalone/deployments/ROOT.war\n\nThen a learning/Makefile to (optionally) make things a bit smoother:\nall:\n\tdocker rm -f immut-test || true\n\tdocker rmi immut-learning || true\n\tlein immutant war\n\tdocker build -t immut-learning .\n\nrun:\n\tdocker run --name immut-test --rm -t -i -p 127.0.0.1:8081:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9991:9990 --link keycloak:auth immut-learning\n\nJust one more thing: Due to the linking between containers, you may need to add a line to your /etc/hosts so that the application will appropriately talk to the Keycloak server. The line should look like this:\n127.0.0.1 auth\n\nThen, edit your keycloak.json and set the auth-server-url:\n\"auth-server-url\": \"http://auth:8080/auth\",\nRunning\nYou should now be able to build and start the application with:\nmake &amp;&amp; make run\n\nAfter waiting for boot, browsing to http://localhost:8081/test should yield you a page that says, roughly:\nBase = \"test\"\n\nNo user found.\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nExploring\nUser routes\nNow, try visiting http://localhost:8081/locked. You should get redirected to the familiar Keycloak login screen. Log in with the user account. You should see something roughly like:\nBase = \"locked Sub: test\"\n\nToken is:\n\norg.keycloak.representations.IDToken@7f55bb4f\n\nUser is:\n\nuser\n\n\nFantastic. Now, try navigating to the admin route at http://localhost:8081/admin. You should see the helpful Forbidden error. This is exactly what we want!\nAdmin routes\nIn order to change accounts, you, unfortunately, can't browse to http://localhost:8081/logout. This seems to be a bug to be squashed in the next version of Keycloak (Bug), but I'll leave it here for posterity. For now, navigate to http://localhost:8080/auth, log in as admin, navigate to the Sessions and Tokens and click the blue Logout All button.\nBrowse back to http://localhost:8081/admin and log in as admin. You should see:\nBase = \"admin\"\n\nToken is:\n\norg.keycloak.representations.IDToken@4a8ca873\n\nUser is:\n\nadmin\n\nYou should also be able to hit all other routes as the admin.

Some notes:\n\nA subsequence of $$ s $$ is a set $$ v $$ such that $$ v \\subset s $$, and the items in $$ v $$ appear in the same order as they appear in $$ s $$.\nAn increasing subsequence of $$ s $$ is a subsequence $$ v $$ such that:\n\n$$\nv_1 &lt; v_2 &lt; ... &lt; v_n\n$$\nThe problem calls for some $$ s $$ and some \\( t \\), returning the longest subsequence common between the sets. It is described roughly in this link and a sample solution is described in a following blog post.\nDefining $$ LCIS(s_{1}...s_{n},t_{1}...t_{m},last) $$ recursively:\n\nIf $$ s_{n} = t_{m} $$ and $$ s_{n} &gt; last $$, then\n\n$$\nLCIS = max(\nLCIS(s_{1}...s_{n-1},t_{1}...t_{m-1},s_{n})+1,\nLCIS(s_{1}...s_{n-1},t_{1}...t_{m},last),\nLCIS(s_{1}...s_{n},t_{1}...t_{m-1},last)\n)\n$$\n\nIf \\( s_{n}\\neq t_{m} \\), then\n\n$$\nLCIS=max(\nLCIS(s_{1}...s_{n-1},t_{1}...t_{m},last),\nLCIS(s_{1}...s_{n},t_{1}...t_{m-1},last)\n)\n$$\nWhich is fine and dandy, but it's a super slow recurrence. Think about how many times $$ LCIS(s_1...s_2, t_1...t_2) $$ will be invoked.\nInstead, we'll use Dynamic Programming, which is much less exciting then it sounds. (I don't know about you, but I expect some serious magic, like lasers, from that kind of name.)\nThe basic idea of dynamic programming is to define an optimal substructure and discover overlapping subproblems. Then, we compute the value of the overlapping subproblems in a bottom up fashion, usually via a table or a set of vectors.\nThe recurrence we defined above is an optimal substructure since it will allow us to utilize overlapping calls. (Like $$ LCIS(s_1...s_2, t_1...t_2) $$)\nExamining the problem closely, It's possible to solve this problem using two arrays instead of a matrix. We'll use $$ c $$ which stores the length of the LCIS ending at a given element $$ i $$ and $$ p $$ which stores the previous element of the LCIS (used for reconstruction).\nThe Rust code below is well commented and includes a number of tests.\nuse std::cmp::max;\nuse std::collections::RingBuf;\n\n/// Longest Common Increasing Sequence\n///\n/// Accepts two `Vec&lt;int&gt;`s and returning a `Vec&lt;int&gt;` Which is the LCIS.\n///\n/// Note: There are multiple Longest Common Increasing Sequences in most inputs.\n/// For example, `[5, 3, 6, 2, 7, 1, 8]` and `[1i, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` have\n/// multiple valid results: `[5i, 6, 7, 8]`, `[3i, 6, 7, 8]`, ...\n///\npub fn lcis(s: Vec&lt;int&gt;, t: Vec&lt;int&gt;) -&gt;

Unfortunately I didn't cover how to utilize it's RPC capabilities. In Rust, this is via the capnp-rpc-rust crate.\nLet's do that!\nWhat's RPC?\nRemote Procedure Calls (RPC) are basically what they say on the box. You issue one from some client to some server and the server responds (or not!) with some response.\nMost protocols have some form of language-agnostic schema, not unlike SQL I suppose, which they use to describe interchange data (structs and fns). A tool is generally used to create a stub, which the programmer then architects.\n\nOne of the orgininal Remote Procedure Call papers can be found here. Cap'n Proto has it's own RPC Spec.\n\nSo if you want to foo() on bar you can do that. But how is this different than just shuffling off packets to one another?\nNetworks are unreliable and unordered. Your UDP packets might get dropped, reordered, or mishandled. \"Ha! I'll use TCP!\" You say? Sure, okay, this solves part of the issue. Are you willing to pay the round-trips? What happens when the other host goes down? What happens when the router dies? How do you respond to your client? A protocol like Cap'n Proto has more well defined failure modes.\nYou don't need to keep track of so many things. Say we're using UDP, that means we need to label packets and track which ones we haven't recieved responses for. Okay, sure, what happens when we have a couple get lost? Do you \"garbage collect\" them? Do they leak forever? Using TCP? You're no much better off, you need to either pay the handshake cost every call or track all those connections!\nIt implements a more understandable interface. You write code once, then you read it many more times. Then you rewrite it, then cycle repeats. How often do you want to spend trying to trace packets through your application? Does it scale? Do you really expect contributors to understand your mess? RPCs look and feel more like Local Procedure Calls (LPC) and can make things easier to comprehend.\nOur Example\nToday we'll be implementing mock calls for the Raft protocol. On page 4 you'll find the calls that we'll be implementing.\nIn short:\n\nAppendEntries which appends entries to a replicated log on all other Raft nodes in the cluster.\nRequestVote which a Candidate uses to request the vote of other nodes so it may become a Leader.\n\nThere is also another call specified, but that is left as practice for the reader. (Feel free to share your results!)\nIn the Schema\nCap'n Proto uses interface to declare calls. Let's take a look what will be src/schema/raft.capnp:\n@0xf64213cd3ccb41d5;\n# unique file ID, generated by `capnp id`\n\ninterface Raft {\n    appendEntries @0 (term :UInt64,\n                      leaderId :UInt64,\n                      prevLogIndex :UInt64,\n                      prevLogTerm :UInt64,\n                      entries :List(Text),\n                      leaderCommit :UInt64)\n                      -&gt; (term :UInt64, success :Bool);\n    requestVote @1 (term :UInt64,\n                    candidateId :UInt64,\n                    lastLogIndex :UInt64,\n                    lastLogTerm :UInt64)\n                    -&gt; (term :UInt64, voteGranted :Bool);\n}\n\nJust like in the structs we declared in the previous article, these are also decorated with @n. Again, it's probably a good idea to keep them in order.\nOne neat thing is multiple returns. This means you can return more than just a single struct or value from a call.\nOne gotcha is that, as in the previous article, the data types don't translate directly into familiar interfaces. For example, I was not able to successfully create a :List(Text) from a vector, some adaptation is required.\n\nIf you don't have Cap'n Proto set up yet (or it's out of date) you can follow the instructions here.\n\nFrom here, you can generate your .rs file.\ncapnp compile -o rust src/schema/*.capnp\n\nYou should now see src/schema/raft_capnp.rs and it will contain the generated implementation. In RPC terms, this are your stubs.\nDon't cross your eyes too much at that code. The just of it is that Cap'n Proto is mostly driven by Reader and Builder implementations. You also might notice that List types need to be constructed a bit differently.\n\nThis all might feel a bit weird because Cap'n Proto lays things out in memory such that they are serialized at rest, before being sent. Read more on the encoding...\n\nBuilding Off Stubs\nBefore we even get into Rust code make sure you have the following packages in your Cargo.toml:\n[dependencies]\ncapnp = \"*\"\ncapnpc = \"*\"\ncapnp-rpc = \"*\"\n\nIn src/main.rs of our test project we'll need to have some imports:\nextern crate capnp;\nextern crate capnpc;\nextern crate \"capnp-rpc\" as capnp_rpc;\nmod raft_capnp {\n    include!(\"./schema/raft_capnp.rs\");\n}\nuse std::thread;\nuse raft_capnp::raft as Raft;\nuse capnp::capability::{FromServer, Server};\nuse capnp_rpc::capability::{InitRequest, LocalClient, WaitForContent};\nuse capnp_rpc::ez_rpc::{EzRpcServer, EzRpcClient};\n\nNote: Because capnp-rpc is not a valid crate name we need to alias it. We'll also use mod raft_capnp { include!(...) } because of some scoping issues with the Cap'n Proto implementation. Since our raft_capnp::raft would normally be capitalized if it were a native Rust implementation I've gone ahead and done that as well.\nNext, in order to make our stubs something more than just nothing we'll go ahead and implement them. In our case, RaftImpl is an empty struct since we're just fiddling. But this is a good place to put stateful things since the handlers will recieve a &amp;mut self.\nstruct RaftImpl;\nimpl Raft::Server for RaftImpl {\n    fn append_entries(&amp;mut self, mut context: Raft::AppendEntriesContext) { }\n    fn request_vote(&amp;mut self, mut context: Raft::RequestVoteContext) { }\n}\nWorking with Context\nSo you might have looked at the parameters to our calls and realized they don't look anything like the ones we wrote in the schema. They show up in mut context.\n\nWhy? Because, like structs in Cap'n Proto, RPC calls are also laid out in memory in creative ways. So we'll need to use getters to access them.\n\nLet's work through getting the parameters inside of our AppendEntries call.\nlet (params, mut results) = context.get();\n\nSo context breaks down into the params, and the results. The idea is that you read from the params and write to the (mutable) results.\nlet term = params.get_term();\nlet leader_id = params.get_leader_id();\nlet prev_log_index = params.get_prev_log_index();\nlet prev_log_term = params.get_prev_log_term();\nlet leader_commit = params.get_leader_commit();\n\nAccessors look pretty standard here, the parameters come out as types we'd expect (In this case, u64). For a List things are a bit different.\nlet entries = {\n    let target = params.get_entries();\n    let size = target.len();\n    let mut entries = Vec::with_capacity(size as usize);\n    for i in 0..size {\n        entries.push(target.get(i).to_string());\n    }\n    entries\n};\n\nUnfortunately, I wasn't able to figure out a painless way of extracting a full set of values from the list without doing a manual walk like this. However, if you're working with 'real' code you might be able to avoid such things. The scope is important here, note how we limit it.\nAt the end of the call we can set the results and close the context.\nresults.set_term(1u64);\nresults.set_success(true);\n\ncontext.done();\n\nAfter, Cap'N Proto will go and return our results. It should be noted that some cases requests can be piplined into other requests. I haven't dug too deeply into this yet but you can explore more in this example. Once I have a more firm understanding of things I'll probably write about pipelining.\nErecting a Server\nThe server part of our application will consume our RaftImpl and listen on a specific address. In order to simplify testing, we'll kick it off into a new thread because once .serve() is called the thread will block.\nthread::spawn(move || {\n    let rpc_server = EzRpcServer::new(\"localhost:8080\").unwrap();\n    let raft_server = Box::new(Raft::ServerDispatch { server : Box::new(RaftImpl)}) as Box&lt;Server+Send&gt;;\n    rpc_server.serve(raft_server);\n});\n\nIn the RPC repository's example, @dwrensha mentiones that there should be a better way to create raft_server but I've not been able to find any myself. If you have suggestions please speak your peace!\nWorking with a Client\nCreating a client is fairly straightforward, the only thing I would note is that the ::new(\"$ADDRESS\") parameter is the server's address.\nlet mut rpc_client = EzRpcClient::new(\"localhost:8080\").unwrap();\nlet raft_client: Raft::Client = rpc_client.get_main();\n\nFinally, creating a request involves using the Builder implementation from the Rust code we generated from the Schema. Again, creating a List is a bit different than you might be used to.\nprintln!(\"Issuing append_entries.\");\n{\n    let mut request = raft_client.append_entries_request();\n    let mut builder = request.init();\n\n    builder.set_term(0u64);\n    builder.set_leader_id(0u64);\n    builder.set_prev_log_index(0u64);\n    builder.set_prev_log_term(0u64);\n    // Do entries in a sec.\n    builder.set_leader_commit(0u64);\n    // Entry creation is scoped.\n    {\n        let mut entries = builder.init_entries(2u32);\n        entries.set(0, \"Foo\");\n        entries.set(1, \"Bar\");\n    }\n    let mut promise = request.send();\n\n    let response = promise.wait().unwrap();\n    let term = response.get_term();\n    let success = response.get_success();\n}\nFurther Exploration\nThese are unsolved problems that I've been working on which I'm hoping the community can offer suggestions on. I'll update this post and credit any bright ideas!\nIssuing calls to many servers at the same time. Simply attempting to .wait() in a loop is wholly inadequate for the implementation of RequestVote. How can we do better? Perhaps with multiple clients and a 'barrier'? Issue here.\n// TODO\n\nHaving other events occuring on the server thread. In our implementation of Raft we'd ideally like to keep the requirements of a RaftNode down to a single thread, but we need to have timer events. I'm curious if this might be able to integrate with MIO to do this.\n// TODO\n\nPipelining multiple requests. Cap'n Proto has a feature called \"Pipelining\" which allows you to make multiple RPC calls in only one network trip (with some limitations). I have yet to come up with an understandable, simple example for this, suggestions?\n// TODO\nClosing Thoughts\nAs before, one of the biggest stumbling blocks to using Cap'n Proto in Rust is the lack of documentation. There are only a few examples and the majority of the code does not have rustdoc comments, so exploring the API is usually a best-effort attempt. If you have an interest in writing documentation I'd highly suggest this project!\nI think that Cap'n Prot's RPC mechanisms offer something better then just shuffling around packets. In addition to allowing for more comprehension, it can also improve compatability and speed.\n\nThis post is discussed on Reddit.\n\n\nYou can play with the full code here.\n\n\nThanks to @dwrensha for proofreading this!\n\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/learning-capn-proto-rpc/","title":"Learning Cap'n Proto RPC"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/lets-encrypt/":{"body":"I was privileged to recieve one of the early Let's Encrypt beta certificates for https://hoverbear.org.

Along the way we'll install Linux, configure firewalls and web servers, set up virtual machines, tinker with system knobs, explore automation tools, and generally have a great time.\nIn this post, We'll discuss things to keep in mind when searching for your own hosting, things to look for, and the differences between distinctions.\nThis series is not intended to be a comprehensive guide. These are just the notes and rambling of a hobbyist server admin who's loved tinkering for over a decade. I'm writing these both for my own future reference, and so my readers can suggest improvements! As always, comments are welcome via email.\nBackground and Goals\nI recently obtained a new server from Hetzner and wanted to take time to document how I setup and configure it. I like writing too, so I figured a blog series is really the best option! Perhaps I'll help someone else as well.\nIn starting this process I realized that many people aren't really sure where to start. The process can actually be pretty overwhelming. Just what is a 'server' anyways? What is most appropriate for your application, Ethical Hosting, Funtoo Containers, or something like mine? What's it like to have a server? How do we interact with it? How do we shop for one?\nWhat's a Server?\nThe word conjures up many fantastical images in our heads. But let's face it, at it's core a server is just a computer. Sure, it's a lot different than the ones in your fridge, but it's not all that much different from your phone in many respects.\nGenerally, when we speak of servers we're referring to them that way because they receive requests and serve them. For most of us, this concept works best by going \"Okay say you visit a website,\" and that diagram has these two (very simplified) steps:\nYou -&gt; Internet -&gt; Server\nYou &lt;- Internet &lt;- Server\n\nThe 'server' is always located on a physical machine running somewhere in the world, this is the metal which we're running on. A server could be a whole machine, a virtualized machine, or they could just be a simple daemon process. They can be roughly anologized as real estate. Each has different qualities to observe.\nThe Dedicated Server\n\nThe single-family home.\n\nIt's possible to obtain use of an entire 'server' machine for yourself. These are typically either homebrew servers, servers purchased and co-located in datacenters, or rented units owned by a provider. Typically dedicated servers are (by far) the most powerful, and typically have a great bang for your buck since they're mostly DIY.\nThese units are great for people who like to experiment, tinker, and manage their own space. Expect to be responsible for your own backups, your own system configuration, and your own troubleshooting. In return, you get absolute freedom. Install anything you want, break anything you want, do anything you want.\nMost dedicated server providers are data center operators or companies who have partnerships with them. Example providers are 1984 and Hetzner, both recommended by persons I respect.\nAs a computer scientist, I treat my personal server like a laboratory, and I'm opting for this choice.\nThe Virtual Private Server\n\nThe condo.\n\nOften it's not necessary to have all the raw power a dedicated server can offer. You may only need a couple GB of RAM, or want to keep costs low. Virtual Private Servers, or VPS are in a good space this way. It's entirely possible to spend under $20 USD a month on hosting.\nThese units are part of multi-tenant dedicated servers, and you get a fair 'slice' of the server for your monthly cost. In most cases you don't even notice your neighbors, but rarely you get bad luck and have to share space with a bad neighbor.\nVPS come in a few varieties: KVM, container, and other. KVM based VPS still allow you to run container systems (such as Docker and Rkt), while a container based VPS actually places you inside one of these. It's also possible to find exotic or esoteric hosting, such as being a Windows Server guest, they might not be the best choice.\nThe VPS space is filled with great providers. I've personally used Funtoo Containers for years and always really enjoyed them. Linode and Digital Ocean are also very well known, and both feature locations outside of the US!\nMany VPS operators also offer additional features such as snapshot backups and things that dedicated servers leave up to the user.\nIf you're going to be exploring your first server a VPS is a great way to go, both for cost and abilities.\nThe Web host\n\nThe hotel.\n\nPerhaps the most popular offering of hosting, simple web hosting typically involves you recieving an sftp account on a server and having access to some of the folder structure. These services are preconfigured with access to PostgresSQL and PHP configured. The service is very similar to what one would experience on Gitlab or Github pages.\nThese services are typically very inexpensive, however they offer very little in the way of control or flexibility. However if your only interest is hosting a Wordpress site this is a great choice. Not only do most of these services offer automated configuration of things like Wordpress, they also do all the hard work of securing and maintaining it.\nAt places I've worked we've had great success with the Canadian provider Ethical Host. Don't be fooled by the dated website, John (the owner) is extremely competent and very responsive to support.\nIf your dreams are to have a web presence and tinker around with PHP or themes, this is a great choice.\nThings to look for\nThere are a few things to be looking for in a server, these points only (really) apply to Dedicated and VPS servers. Web Hosts typically you aren't even told these specifics.\n\nMultiple Cores: Server processors are amazing and if you're investing in a server you likely want the features and power of a proper Xeon core. Prefer a Xeon (or equivalent) over a consumer grade chip. These are generally 4-8 core and offer hyperthreading. If you're not using a dedicated host you likely will only share this processor. That's quite ok.\nLots of RAM: These days it's entirely practical to find dedicated machines with 32+GB of RAM. Virtual Servers typically have very affordable 4GB variants. Remember that RAM won't 'add' speed to your services magically, but if you're running lots of things it will definitely make an improvement.\nSolid State Drives: There's an argument for spinning rust, but for most uses you will not need more than perhaps 100GB of storage. Instead of opting for a big disk, opt for a fast disk. If you need bulk storage consider looking for a dedicated storage box or bucket, which are very economical.\nReasonable Bandwidth Capacity: Having fluctuating costs really sucks, so does getting charged for bandwidth. Consider your use case and expected traffic, also consider scaling.\nRemote Access: Your server shuts down. How do you turn it back on? How can you get into the bootloader? How can you request USB sticks to be plugged in? These are all questions you need to be able to answer.\nData Location: How does your provider treat your data? What level of privacy can you expect? If you're providing services to minors, marginalized or threatened people, or collecting any personal information you should be aware of the host country's laws. I'd highly suggest staying out of the USA for your hosting options, observing the current saga unfolding around privacy and data ownership.\n\nFor all storage and bandwidth related estimations you can consider pictures, songs, presentations/documents as all roughly 5MB. This is generous but you'll be thankful later.\nNext post we'll discuss how to install a dedicated host.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/new-roots-1/","title":"New Roots part 1, Choosing a Server"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/new-roots-2/":{"body":"This is the second post of a series on settling into new servers. The first was about choosing a server. This post is specifically targetted at newly acquired VPS and Dedicated servers. We'll talk about installing our chosen distribution, configuring its basics, and familiarizing ourselves with the new metal.\nWhat Distribution?\nThis choice is entirely dependent on your personal tastes and use case. Different distributions are catered well to different things, even different installation media of specific distributions are different enough to warrant considering.\nYou might be interested in Ubuntu if you're new to Linux or interested in doing things the 'Official' way the majority of the time. CentOS is another fantastic choice, particularly if you're seeking to learn more about the enterprise space. You'll find these two options on virtually every provider you work with, and should familiarize yourself with at least one.\nOut of the others, Arch Linux is my particular favorite. To me, it's an umami distribution with (lots of) up-to-date signed packages, a simple core, amazing documentation, and a rolling release schedule. I've been using it for years and the original creator actually attended the same University I did. You may also have a distribution which you are very comfortable with, and you may choose to use it.\nServers do, though, have different requirements. You will not want to install a GUI specific distribution onto a headless server. Additionally, many providers will limit what can be installed on their machines. In some cases they offer a LARA, a direct console to the machine, for installation, but you'll need to verify this is possible.\nMuch to my joy, Hetzner offers Arch Linux as part of their Install Image. Their install scripts are very general though, and installing a different choice is a similar process.\n\n        Several Options\n        \n    \nRescue Me!\nAll providers are different in how this process will work. Some will have more options, some will be graphical, others will be more buggy. It's very important you become familiar with this process and understand what you're doing. You don't want to accidently wipe your machine, or find yourself in an emergency reinstall situation then realize you don't know how to set things up.\nWith Hetzner you can select a rescue image from their web UI allows you to SSH in using your pre-provided key. You can also generally choose premade images from a similar panel of the web UI, in Hetzner's UI has this under the \"Linux\" tab.\n\n        The rescue web UI\n        \n    \nFrom this system, you can either run something like the provided installimage or install your own system. Since we want to experiment let's just install our own! If you choose to use installimage you'll find it to be very painless.\nGetting the Image\nFirst, we'll pull down our ISO image. This snippet will discover, fetch, and verify the latest Arch Linux chroot bootstrap. You're able to just paste it into your ssh session.\nVERSION=$(curl https://mirrors.kernel.org/archlinux/iso/latest/ | grep -Poh '(?&lt;=archlinux-bootstrap-)\\d*\\.\\d*\\.\\d*(?=\\-x86_64)' | head -n 1)\ncurl https://mirrors.kernel.org/archlinux/iso/latest/archlinux-bootstrap-$VERSION-x86_64.tar.gz -o /tmp/archlinux-bootstrap-$VERSION-x86_64.tar.gz\ncurl https://mirrors.kernel.org/archlinux/iso/latest/archlinux-bootstrap-$VERSION-x86_64.tar.gz.sig -o /tmp/archlinux-bootstrap-$VERSION-x86_64.tar.gz.sig\n# Pull Pierre Schmitz PGP Key.\n# https://www.archlinux.org/people/developers/#pierre\n# http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&amp;fingerprint=on&amp;exact=on&amp;search=0x4AA4767BBC9C4B1D18AE28B77F2D434B9741E8AC\ngpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 9741E8AC\n# Verify its integrity.\ngpg --verify /tmp/archlinux-bootstrap-$VERSION-x86_64.tar.gz.sig\n\nYou should get some output saying the signature was good. That means we can use it! We know this image is legitimate because we:\n\nKnow Pierre is an Arch Linux developer.\nKnow that we have his key from a trusted server at MIT.\nDownloaded the archive and the signature from an https source.\nVerified the archive.\n\nWasn't that hard? No, no it wasn't. It took us barely any time at all.\nFoundational File Systems\nYou can review your available drives with this:\nlsblk --paths --scsi\n\nAnd you should see some output like so:\nNAME       SIZE OWNER GROUP MODE       NAME     HCTL       TYPE VENDOR   MODEL             REV TRAN\n/dev/sda 232.9G root  disk  brw-rw+++- /dev/sda 1:0:0:0    disk ATA      Crucial_CT250MX2 MU03 sata\n/dev/sdb 232.9G root  disk  brw-rw+++- /dev/sdb 2:0:0:0    disk ATA      Crucial_CT250MX2 MU03 sata\n\nFor our configuration, we'll use the btrfs filesystem which supports multiple devices. You may wish to review the Arch wiki page as well.\nI'm choosing to map both my whole disks into a btrfs volume with mirroring across disks. This should give me consistency against disk failures.\nHOSTNAME=silicon\nmkfs.btrfs -f -L $HOSTNAME -d raid1 -m raid1 /dev/sda /dev/sdb\n\nIf your drives are solid state this process will also issue full TRIM commands to them which is good.\nYou can test that the RAID is working by doing this:\n# Make folders for them.\nmkdir -p /mnt/sda\nmkdir -p /mnt/sdb\n# Make a test write.\nmount /dev/sda /mnt/sda\necho \"Hello World\" &gt; /mnt/sda/hello\numount /mnt/sda\n# Make a test read.\nmount /dev/sdb /mnt/sdb\ncat /mnt/sdb/hello\n# Returns \"Hello World\" from the file.\nrm /mnt/sdb/hello\numount /mnt/sdb\n\nCool huh? So if your one drives ever dies the other should continue to function. It's like a backup! But it isn't. This won't protect you from stupidity or attacks. If you'd prefer to have more space use -d raid0 to enable striping instead when running mkfs.btrfs.\nIf you need to sync the raid mirroring because you have a new disk you can do btrfs balance start. I've never actually had a case where I've used this failsafe, so if anyone has experience with it I'd definitely appreciate your feedback.\nNext we'll set up some initial mountpoints and subvolumes.\nmount -o compress=lzo /dev/sda /mnt\n# Will go on /\nbtrfs subvolume create /mnt/root\n# Will go on /home\nbtrfs subvolume create /mnt/home\n# Will go on /var/cache/pacman\nbtrfs subvolume create /mnt/pacman-cache\n# Will go on /var/cache/abs\nbtrfs subvolume create /mnt/abs-cache\n\nBTRFS is a 'Copy-on-Write' filesystem and we can use these subvolumes like we would partitions. We get a few other cool features though, we can take (basically) free snapshots of them whenever we want, and we can easily send and recieve them. These snapshots behave just like folders for everyday use.\nCreating seperate root, home and *-cache filesystems is done for a few reasons.\n\nroot will be the core of our system, and what runs day-to-day. We make this a subvolume so we can take snapshots of our running system and use them later in case something goes wrong. It's fairly cheap to make snapshots of this since the only things that will change are updated packages and configurations.\nhome is where you store all of the user data. This data is, generally, version independent of what's running on your system. It's unlikely if you roll back root you'll also want to lose your latest changes to home.\npacman-cache is where we'll store the Arch Linux official repository caches. It stores previous and current versions of packages installed. Along with the abs-cache these are likely things you'll want to share between all snapshots.\nabs-cache is where we'll store our ABS tree cache. It stores builds from the AUR.\n\nYou may be asking \"Why not a seperate boot?\" and that's an extremely good question! From my experience, one thing that happens when you use a seperate boot is your kernel version starts to conflict with various modules (such as ntfs-3g) when the kernel is new but the root is old. This is a new strategy I'm trying. Another reason no boot was made is because we're not encrypting the disk, so there is no need.\nNow let's mount things in their destined paths:\numount /dev/sda\nmount -o subvol=root /dev/sda /mnt\nmkdir -p /mnt/home\nmount -o subvol=home /dev/sda /mnt/home\nmkdir -p /mnt/var/cache/pacman\nmount -o subvol=pacman-cache /dev/sda /mnt/var/cache/pacman\nmkdir -p /mnt/var/cache/abs\nmount -o subvol=abs-cache /dev/sda /mnt/var/cache/abs\nBootstrapping to Base\nWith our filesystem and subvolumes mounted, it's time to install Arch Linux.\ncd /mnt\ntar --strip-components 1 --extract --preserve-permissions --gzip --file=/tmp/archlinux-bootstrap-$VERSION-x86_64.tar.gz\n\nIf you issue an ls things should now look like a normal happy Linux installation. From here you can chroot in with the following command:\n./bin/arch-chroot .\n\nThe environment we find ourself in is very minimal, it doesn't even contain a full copy of base! But from here, we can do everything! You should see something like sh-4.3# as your prompt.\n# Setup a mirror.\nMIRRORLIST=/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist\necho -e \"Server = https://mirrors.kernel.org/archlinux/\\$repo/os/\\$arch\\n`cat $MIRRORLIST`\" &gt; $MIRRORLIST\n# Setup Keys\npacman-key --init\npacman-key --populate archlinux\n# Install base, must do this before locales since we don't have sed installed!\npacman -Syu --noconfirm base btrfs-progs\n# Configure Locales\nLOCALES=/etc/locale.gen\necho -e \"en_CA.UTF-8 UTF-8\\nde_DE.UTF-8 UTF-8\\n`cat $LOCALES`\" &gt; $LOCALES\nlocale-gen\n\nNext we need to configure the /etc/fstab file to make sure the boot process is able to understand what's happening. At this point you're likely noticing you don't have a text editor. Let's keep it that way for now, just for fun. You can review the syntax with cat /etc/fstab.\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt;&gt; /etc/fstab\n/dev/sda    /                   btrfs   subvol=root,rw,relatime,ssd,space_cache,compress=lzo            0   0\n/dev/sda    /home               btrfs   subvol=home,rw,relatime,ssd,space_cache,compress=lzo            0   0\n/dev/sda    /var/cache/pacman   btrfs   subvol=pacman-cache,rw,relatime,ssd,space_cache,compress=lzo    0   0\n/dev/sda    /var/cache/abs      btrfs   subvol=abs-cache,rw,relatime,ssd,space_cache,compress=lzo       0   0\nEOF\n\nAt this point, we're almost done our base installation.\nUser Creation\nSince you don't want to normally operate as root on your server it's a good idea to create a new user. Let's quickly configure sudo first so when we get our new user working we can still do fun things.\npacman -S sudo\nEDITOR=nvim visudo\n\nIn here you want to enable users in the sudo group to utilize sudo, uncomment the following line:\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nThen you can create the group:\ngroupadd sudo\n\nFinally, create your new user:\nUSER=hoverbear\nuseradd -m -G sudo $USER\npasswd hoverbear\n\nFinally, grab your public keys and set up for your user.\nGITHUB_USER=hoverbear\nsu $USER -c \"mkdir -p /home/$USER/.ssh &amp;&amp; curl -o /home/$USER/.ssh/authorized_keys https://github.com/$GITHUB_USER.keys &amp;&amp; chmod 600 /home/$USER/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\nSSH\nObviously we need to run SSH to access our new install. At this point, let's finally install our editor. I like neovim for strange reason, but you can pick other things.\nEDITOR=neovim\npacman -S openssh $EDITOR\n\nNow you can open /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Read through everything here! I'm going to tweak the following knobs:\nPermitRootLogin no\n# Only let specific users log in.\nAllowUsers hoverbear\n# Use a big key.\nServerKeyBits 4096\n# We'll use SSH keys only.\nPasswordAuthentication no\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\n\nWe'll enable both sshd which will give us remote access when we reboot:\nsystemctl enable sshd\nNetworking\nWe'll just quickly set up a basic networking configuration for now which we can build on later. First we'll enable the two services needed:\nsystemctl enable systemd-networkd\nsystemctl enable systemd-resolved\nln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf\n\nThen we'll create the necessary files.\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; /etc/systemd/network/physical.network\n[Match]\n# Make sure this matches your adapter from the ip addr command\nName=enp*\n\n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv4\nEOF\nBooting\nDealing with bootloaders is usually fairly arcane in my experience, and debugging a remote boot sounds just awful. We want something basically failsafe. If something does go wrong, we want to be able to fix it from the rescue system. Let's take the recommended solution of Arch, Grub.\npacman -S --noconfirm grub\ngrub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\ngrub-install /dev/sda\nThe Moment of Truth!\nYou can get out of your chroot with exit, then reboot the machine.\nreboot\n\nWith any luck, in a few minutes you'll be able to ssh in again. I found with Hetzner you may need to issue an automatic reset from their online console, you might need to as well.\n\n        Mine works! :)\n        \n    \nIn our next post we'll talk about configuring your server's services and doing some hardening.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/new-roots-2/","title":"New Roots part 2, On the Metal"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/new-roots-3/":{"body":"This is the third in a series of posts about getting settled into a server. First we talked about choosing a server, then we talked about installing a base OS on a dedicated server. In this post we'll discuss configuring, securing, and hardening our server.\nIn our last post we left our new server in a very, very minimal state. Heck, we didn't even tell it it's own name! In this post we'll talk about configuration. Throughout this process we're going to try to keep things simple and tightly knit. Through most of this guide you'll need to be using sudo or acting as root.\n\nI'm purposely choosing some things I'm not familiar with to learn as I go, so please feel free to offer any advice you might have.\nHostname\nWe can set the hostname with the following command:\nHOSTNAME=silicon\nhostnamectl set-hostname $HOSTNAME\n\nThis writes the hostname to /etc/hostname. After you'll want to look in /etc/hosts. Here's what mine ended up like after I was done editing it. I'm setting up a host called silicon on the hoverbear.org domain.\n#\n# /etc/hosts: static lookup table for host names\n#\n\n#&lt;ip&gt;\t    &lt;hostname.domain.org&gt;\t     &lt;hostname&gt;\n127.0.0.1       silicon.local  silicon\n::1             silicon.local  silicon\n138.201.63.106  silicon.hoverbear.org    silicon\n\nYou can test that the local name is working with ping $HOSTNAME.\nNow that our server thinks it's $HOSTNAME we need to tell everything else in the world that it is! If you happen to have a domain name, you should go to your provider's DNS console and route $HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN.$TLD to your device's IP address. You can find this with ip addr.\nFor me that looked like adding a line to a table with the following information:\nsilicon     138.201.63.106      A (Address)\n\nGo make yourself a tea, then try pinging your server from a different machine a few minutes later.\nFQDN=silicon.hoverbear.org\nping $FQDN\n\nOnce it starts working you're all set with your domain name! Do note it can take up to 24 hours for global DNS propagation.\nTime\nOne choice which may bring up confusion is the timezone to set your server to. If you're only going to be hosting services in one time zone you may wish to simply set it to that. If you provide services internationally the question becomes more unclear. One option is UTC.\nOne thing to consider while evaluating your options on time is to consider how you'll be hosting your services. Later we'll talk about using containers to host your services, and these can all operate on their own timezones. You can review timezones available with timedatectl list-timezones.\nProperly designed programs will store timezones as part of their dates, but not all programs are properly designed. Changing your timezone later can temporarily cause rather strange issues, so be forwarned.\nI'm going to just choose my current local time for now. Since my root host won't be running any time sensitive services I can change it without worrying too much.\ntimedatectl set-timezone Canada/Pacific\n\nSince we're running a server that will, ultimately, be responsible for possibly time-sensitive data it might be a good idea to ensure we have accurate times. In order to do this we'll enable an ntp service.\ntimedatectl set-ntp true\nA Simple Firewall\nMost modern kernels come built in with iptables and nftables support already. In Arch, iptables is pulled in as part of base. nftables is a newer 'spiritual successor' to iptables however there is little practical real world documentation. Since some of the things we'll be doing later on will be utilizing iptables it's probably a good idea to use that.\nThere is a menagerie of different frontends for iptables that put a layer between you and it. However iptables isn't that difficult to understand and has some great documentation. Learning how to understand what's happening in iptables will make using even frontends easier later on, if you even choose to use them.\nWe'll be referencing the Simple Stateful Firewall for our initial setup.\nSince we're currently on a remote device over SSH we need to be careful not to lock ourselves out. So let's set some basic filter settings in /etc/iptables/iptables.rules:\n*filter\n### Defaults for the chain.\n# Drop anything that we don't catch from input.\n:INPUT DROP [0:0]\n\n# We're not a router, we shouldn't forward anything along a NAT.\n:FORWARD DROP [0:0]\n\n# We trust things running on this machine, so accept them all.\n:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n\n# User defined chains.\n:TCP - [0:0]\n:UDP - [0:0]\n\n# Accept already established or related connections.\n--append INPUT --match conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED --jump ACCEPT\n\n# Accept anything from the local loopback.\n--append INPUT --in-interface lo --jump ACCEPT\n\n# Drop any invalid packets. We can't reject since there's no valid way to reject.\n--append INPUT --match conntrack --ctstate INVALID --jump DROP\n\n# Accept any pings.\n--append INPUT --protocol icmp --match icmp --icmp-type 8 --match conntrack --ctstate NEW --jump ACCEPT\n\n# Attach the user defined chains (UDP, TCP) to valid connections on the\n# respective protocol. Recall that anything established is already accepted.\n--append INPUT --protocol udp --match conntrack --ctstate NEW --jump UDP\n--append INPUT --protocol tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN --match conntrack --ctstate NEW --jump TCP\n\n# Reject TCP connections with TCP RESET packets and UDP streams with ICMP port\n# unreachable messages if the ports are not opened.\n--append INPUT --protocol udp --jump REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable\n--append INPUT --protocol tcp --jump REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset\n\n# Reject all remaining incoming traffic with icmp protocol unreachable messages.\n--append INPUT --jump REJECT --reject-with icmp-proto-unreachable\n\n### TCP Chain\n# Allow SSH connections.\n--append TCP --protocol tcp --dport 22 --jump ACCEPT\n\nCOMMIT\n\nNow you can start and get the status of the iptables service.\nsystemctl start iptables\nsystemctl status iptables\n\nNow try ending your ssh session and hopping back in. If it didn't work you can just reset the machine and try reconfiguring. If it did work then we can enable the service on boot.\nsystemctl enable iptables\n\nAt this point you can review your current settings and see various usages with iptables -nvL:\nChain INPUT (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         \n  215 18609 ACCEPT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED\n    0     0 ACCEPT     all  --  lo     *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           \n    0     0 DROP       all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            ctstate INVALID\n    0     0 ACCEPT     icmp --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            icmptype 8 ctstate NEW\n    1   439 UDP        udp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            ctstate NEW\n    4   188 TCP        tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            tcp flags:0x17/0x02 ctstate NEW\n    1   439 REJECT     udp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            reject-with icmp-port-unreachable\n    2    80 REJECT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            reject-with tcp-reset\n    0     0 REJECT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            reject-with icmp-proto-unreachable\n\nChain FORWARD (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         \n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 146 packets, 20108 bytes)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         \n\nChain TCP (1 references)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         \n    2   108 ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            tcp dpt:22\n\nChain UDP (1 references)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination\n\nAs you can see from the pkts column, our rule in TCP got used for an ssh connection, and the rule for already established connections is also being used.\nHardening\nServers get attacked, it's a fact of life. Let's take some simple steps to help build up a bit of security for ourselves. First let's set some flags in /etc/sysctl.d/50-hardening.conf:\n# Only root can see dmesg\nkernel.dmesg_restrict = 1\n# Restrict kernel pointer access.\nkernel.kptr_restrict = 1\n\n# TCP SYN cookie protection (default) helps protect against SYN flood attacks\n# only kicks in when net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog is reached\nnet.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1\n\n# Protect against tcp time-wait assassination hazards drop RST packets for\n# sockets in the time-wait state (not widely supported outside of linux,\n# but conforms to RFC)\nnet.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337 = 1\n\n# Sets the kernels reverse path filtering mechanism to value 1, it will do\n# source validation of the packet's recieved from all the interfaces on the\n# machine protects from attackers that are using ip spoofing methods to do harm\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.rp_filter = 1\n\n# We will be forwarding for IPv4 to containers. Enable this.\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\n\n# Ignore echo broadcast requests to prevent being part of smurf attacks\nnet.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1\n\n# Ignore bogus icmp errors\nnet.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1\n\n# Protect against some hardlink and symlink vulnerabilities.\nfs.protected_hardlinks = 1\nfs.protected_symlinks = 1\n\nMuch of this configuration was taken from the security guide. Now you can apply the changes with systemctl --system.\nDNS and Name Resolution\nIt's now time to properly configure systemd-resolved. First we'll link its configuration into the old /etc/resolv.conf location for compatability reasons.\nrm /etc/resolv.conf\nln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf\nsystemctl restart systemd-resolved\n\nNext we'll go into /etc/nsswitch.conf and set up to local DNS stub resolver. Change this line:\n+ hosts: files mymachines resolve myhostname\n- hosts: files dns myhostname\n\nNow we can go about creating and modifying files in /etc/systemd/network/. Before going about this it's a good idea to review your network adapters and check out man systemd.network. You can do this with ip addr. You should see a lo and some adapter starting with enp. The enp prefixed adapter is your physical adapter.\nWe can go back and review our previous /etc/systemd/network/physical.network now. Some changes can be made:\n[Match]\n# Make sure this matches your adapter from the ip addr command\nName=enp*\n\n[Network]\nDHCP=ipv4\n# Use global NTP pools\nNTP=0.pool.ntp.org\nNTP=1.pool.ntp.org\nNTP=2.pool.ntp.org\nNTP=3.pool.ntp.org\n\nThen we'll configure /etc/systemd/resolved.conf:\n[Resolve]\n# Specify Google's DNS instead of whatever the default picked by DHCP is.\nDNS=8.8.8.8\nFallbackDNS=8.8.4.4\nLLMNR=true\nReboot &amp; Tea Time\nAt this point we've tinkered with enough things it's a good idea to verify everything is working as intended still. Give your system a reboot, go make yourself a cup of tea (servers take time to reboot), and verify that you can reconnect.\nSo far we've set up a basic firewall, configured time syncronization, added some kernel parameters, and added some basic configuration to our physical network adapter. These are things that you'll likely want to do on your server regardless of what it's final purpose is, and even if you do need to change them this gives you a good basis.\nAt this point our configuration is roughly as so:\ninternet -&gt; host { iptables -&gt; ssh }\n\nOur host is configured through systemd-networkd and name resolution is augmented by systemd-resolved. This configuration places us in a great position to use container based services.\nAdding a New Service (mosh)\nWe'll discuss setting up and networking various services at length in future posts, including example nginx, postgres, nodejs and rust service deployments. We'll end up using containers for these, the idea of using containers for these services is a choice of isolation and modularization. We'd, ideally, like to keep our 'root' system as simple and secure as possible, it shouldn't have the job of hosting any public facing services other than ssh and nginx, and we'll only use nginx to proxy requests to other HTTP servers.\nFor me there is one exception to this rule, mosh. mosh completely changed my experience using ssh, especially over unreliable or mobile connections (such as a laptop). It works by transporting your ssh session data over UDP, and works through changes in IP or situations of large lag.\nThe process for adding any new service will be similar, so even if you're not interested in installing mosh it's good to be familiar with it. We'll use it as an example below.\nInstall: You should choose a reliable, secure source for your service. You should always prefer the official Arch repositories over the AUR or a third party repository, especially on the 'root' of the server.\npacman -S mosh\n\nDiscover: Most externally facing services require a port to bind to (if they're TCP), or recieve from / send through (if they're UDP). You may recall we set up our firewall to accept all outgoing connections, so we only need to configure it to accept incoming data. You can generally discover this by looking in their respective man pages, website, or the configuration itself.\nmosh uses ports starting at 60000 and going up to 60999 if lower numbered ports are not available. It's pretty reasonable to assume that we'll never have more than 100 mosh sessions, so we only need to allow the lower 100 ports.\nAccept: In order to accept data on these ports we'll open them up by adding the following line near the bottom of our /etc/iptables/iptables.rules file, before the COMMIT line.\n# Allow MOSH connections.\n--append UDP --protocol udp --dport 60000:60100 --jump ACCEPT\n\nThen you can restart the firewall with systemctl restart iptables.\nTest: At this point if your new service has a daemon to run you should start it with the appropriate systemctl start $SERVICE command. Then take a moment to test your service and make sure it works as expected.\nWith mosh there is no daemon, we just test by trying to use it!\nHOSTNAME=silicon.hoverbear.org\nmosh $HOSTNAME\n\nEnable: Once you know things are working correctly we can enable it to start at boot if desired with systemctl enable $SERVICE Since mosh has no related daemon we don't need to do this.\nVerify: At this point my mosh service works fine, and we can verify that the firewall is catching this by reviewing iptables -nvL and checking out our UDP chain:\nChain UDP (1 references)\n pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         \n    2   217 ACCEPT     udp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            udp dpts:60000:60100\n\nAs you can see here, the rule was used twice, which means it's working! At this point, we're done setting up the new service. We'll have a chance to practice this more in future posts when we're configuring various serices.\nFor our next post we'll explore nice ways to personalize your server environment and make it feel like home. Remember, there's no place like 127.0.0.1. :)\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/new-roots-3/","title":"New Roots part 3, Services & Hardening"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/new-roots-4/":{"body":"This is the fourth of a series on taking up residence on a new server. In our last post we talked about how to set up some basic network services like ssh and configure iptables, our firewall. In this post we'll talk about making your server feel like home.\nThere are a grand number of things we can do at this point to make our time on the machine enjoyable. Take time to evaluate your choices though. This 'root' host is going to be our 'control seat' so it's not going to be doing much more than orcestrating virtualized environments. Once we configure these environments (next post) we'll be using these for any sort of development, deployment, or experiments.\nWith 'root' our goal is to make a simple set of good, sharp tools to do what we need to do. These are tools like nvim which we installed earlier. If you were following the last host you may have installed mosh as well, which makes our ssh sessions safe from network changes and comfortable against latency.\n\nAfter installing a few more tools we'll discuss configuration of our tools while we overview their functionality and purposes.\nAside: The User Skeleton\nIn /etc/skel you can find the file structure created for a new user. If a user hoverbear is created then everything in /etc/skel is copied into /home/hoverbear (or wherever that user's home directory is).\nOn our 'root' we won't be utilizing this, since we will be the only users (your user and root which is also you). Instead we'll just be modifying the system-wide defaults, this way if we end up acting as the root user or something we'll still have the same configuration.\nThe Shell\nThe prompt you've been typing all these commands at is your shell. There are lots of different shells, this one is bash. I've enjoyed using zsh and fish before as well.  Since this is our 'root' we're just going to stick with the built-in defaults, we can choose a fancy shell to load with lots of sketchy plugins in our less privileged container!\nbash looks for configuration in /etc/bash.bashrc which is overridden by ~/.bashrc. We'll remove these user specific files then edit the system-wide file.\nrm ~/.bashrc\nsudo rm /root/.bashrc\nvim /etc/bash.bashrc\n\nBelow I've included a commented configuration to explain many settings.\n#\n# /etc/bash.bashrc\n#\n\n# If not running interactively, don't do anything.\n[[ $- != *i* ]] &amp;&amp; return\n\n# Use extra globing features. See man bash, search extglob.\nshopt -s extglob\n# Include .files when globbing.\nshopt -s dotglob\n# When a glob expands to nothing, make it an empty string instead of the literal characters.\nshopt -s nullglob\n# A command name that is the name of a directory is executed as if it were the argument to the cd command.\nshopt -s autocd\n# Let bash update the window size if we resize it.\nshopt -s checkwinsize\n\n# This is what you see between every command.\n# Make your own at http://bashrcgenerator.com/\nPS1=\"\\[\\033[38;5;10m\\]\\u\\[$(tput sgr0)\\]\\[\\033[38;5;7m\\]@\\[$(tput sgr0)\\]\\[\\033[38;5;9m\\]\\H\\[$(tput sgr0)\\]\\[\\033[38;5;12m\\]\\w\\[$(tput sgr0)\\]\\[\\033[38;5;3m\\] $(systemctl is-system-running) \\[\\033[38;5;15m\\]\\[$(tput bold)\\]\\$?\\[$(tput sgr0)\\] \\n\\[$(tput sgr0)\\]\\[\\033[38;5;7m\\]\\t\\[$(tput sgr0)\\]\\[\\033[38;5;15m\\] \\[$(tput bold)\\]\\\\$\\[$(tput sgr0)\\] \"\n# The rest can really just be left default.\nPS2='&gt; '\nPS3='&gt; '\nPS4='+ '\n\n# Set up bash completion.\n[ -r /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion   ] &amp;&amp; . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion\n\n# This tells grep to use color when appropriate.\nexport GREP_OPTIONS='--color=auto'\n# Configures the default editor, we installed nvim earlier.\nexport EDITOR='nvim'\n\n# Get colors in ls by default\nalias ls=\"ls --color=auto\"\n\nNow test it out by running bash, your prompt should change. If it looks good exit then exit again and reconnect. This configuration is by no means exotic or impressive, it's just some nice basics.\nThe prompt is intended to clearly communicate where, and who, you are, as well as the exit code. Time can sometimes be useful, so I included it as well. It's all also nicely color coded. Here's how it's structured:\nuser@full.domain.name/current/directory (system state) (last exit code)\n(time) $\n\n(system state) refers to the output of systemctl is-system-running which will output based on this list. In most cases it will either be running if everything is good, or degraded if some service has failed.\n(last exit code) will be 0 if the last command exited successfully, and a different number if it did not.\n\n        My prompt\n        \n    \nThe Multiplexer\nShell multiplexing is a great way to maintain a workspace on a remote machine. The idea is to have a daemon which holds onto your shell sessions for you and essentially acts as a 'window manager' for your various shell panes. You're then able to 'detach' and 'reattach' to these sessions whenever you want.\nI'm aware of tmux and screen which both accomplish this quite well. I prefer tmux and we'll talk about setting up that one. You can find the wiki documentation here. You can get it with pacman:\npacman -S tmux\n\nThe global configuration for tmux lives at /etc/tmux.conf and we can just configure a couple settings:\n# Use a 256 color configuration.\nset -g default-terminal \"screen-256color\"\n\n # Start windows and panes at 1, not 0.\nset -g base-index 1\nset -g pane-base-index 1\n\n# So the history doesn't go on forever.\nset -g history-limit 10000\n\n# Split panes using | and -, this makes more sense!\nbind \\ split-window -h\nbind - split-window -v\nunbind '\"'\nunbind %\n\n# Don't rename windows automatically.

You can rename them with Ctl+b ,. You can split them with Ctl+\\ and Ctl+- respectively. You can move between splits with Ctl+b left and Ctl+b right. With Ctl+b 1 or any number you can change 'tabs'.\nYou can detach tmux with Ctl+b d and you can re-attach with tmux a later on. Sessions will persist between logins but not between reboots.\n\n        Example of tmux\n        \n    \nEditing the Editor\nEarlier we installed nvim with pacman -S neovim. Neovim is a minimal modern recreation of vim which itself was a recreation of vi. There are also editors like emacs, ed, and nano.\nThe nvim systemwide configuration is stored at /etc/xdg/nvim/init.vim, and you might need to create the folder with mkdir -p /etc/xdg/nvim/.\nInside we can do some basic configuration:\n\" Be improved\nset nocompatible\n\n\" General\nset number      \" Show line numbers\nset history=700 \" Commands\nset autoread\nset magic       \" Regex related\nset showmatch   \" Brackets\nset mouse=a     \" Enable all mouse interaction.\nfiletype plugin on\nsyntax enable\nset ttyfast     \" Improve smoothness\nset lazyredraw  \" Don't redraw while executing macros\nset showcmd     \" Show partially typed commands at the bottom\nset wrap        \" Soft wrap lines\n\n\" Indents\nset expandtab\nset smarttab\nset shiftwidth=4\nset tabstop=4\nset ai \" Auto Indent\nset si \" Smart Indent\n\n\" Peace and quiet\n\" (Side note: Vim does a 'bell' very often)\nset noerrorbells\nset novisualbell\n\n\" Searching\nset ignorecase\nset smartcase\nset hlsearch\nset incsearch\n\n\" Don't do some legacy-related things like temporary swapfiles.\nset nobackup\nset nowb\nset noswapfile\n\n\" Tell vim to remember certain things when we exit\n\"  '10  :  marks will be remembered for up to 10 previously edited files\n\"  \"100 :  will save up to 100 lines for each register\n\"  :20  :  up to 20 lines of command-line history will be remembered\n\"  %    :  saves and restores the buffer list\n\"  n... :  where to save the viminfo files\nset viminfo='10,\\\"100,:20,%,n~/.viminfo\n\n\" Automagically restore files we were editing to the line we were on.\nfunction! RestoreLine()\n  if line(\"'\\\"\") &lt;= line(\"$\")\n    normal! g`\"\n    return 1\n  endif\nendfunction\naugroup restoreLine\n  autocmd!\n  autocmd BufWinEnter * call RestoreLine()\naugroup END\n\n\" Colorscheme\ncolorscheme spacegrey\n\nNow we need to fetch the colorscheme, Spacegrey.\nmkdir -p /etc/xdg/nvim/colors/\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajh17/Spacegray.vim/master/colors/spacegray.vim -o /etc/xdg/nvim/colors/spacegrey.vim\n\nAt this point nvim is quite capable of doing any task we might need of it. Triumph in this by telling the system you and it are officially in a relationship.\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt;&gt; /etc/bash.bashrc\n\n# Use nvim\nexport EDITOR=nvim\nEOF\nFinal Steps\nSince it's probably been a couple days since you started this process, it's also a good idea to update:\n\nCheck the Arch Frontpage in case there is any news item you need to be aware of.\nIssue pacman -Syu.\n\nBefore moving on it might be a good idea to make a snapshot of what we have so far, this way we can roll back. This is a very cool feature of BTRFS and one of the main reasons I use it. Since this is technically our / the process is a bit more involved than usual.\n# First, mount the BTRFS volume somewhere plainly, no subvolume.\nmount -o compress=lzo /dev/sda /mnt/\ncd /mnt\n# Create a read-only snapshot of `root` called `root-fresh`.\nsudo btrfs subvolume snapshot -r root root-fresh\n\nIf you ever find yourself in a situation where you just need to restart all over again, this is a snapshot you can use so you don't have to re-do all your configuration and setup. You would just have to:\n\nBoot into recovery.\nMount the filesystem with mount -o compress=lzo /dev/sda /mnt/.\nbtrfs subvolume delete /mnt/root\nbtrfs subvolume snapshot /mnt/root-fresh /mnt/root\n\nFor now this will give you a way to return back to this exact point while we dork around with containers. You can also mount it (like the other subvolumes) and recover defaults in case something gets bungled in your current system.\nIn later posts we'll be discussing BTRFS more in regards to how it works with containers and backups.\nReady to Go\nTry running our three configured programs as both root and your $USER, their configurations should be the same. Our system has been configured to act in a simple, usable manner and behave with little surprising behaivor. Below you can see it with nvim /etc/iptables/iptables.rules, systemd-cgtop and journalctl -f running.\n\n        An Example\n        \n    \nWhat's perhaps most important to remember throughout this process is that you kept this system very clean. Next post we'll discuss using containers to construct virtual environments, which we can be much more messy with!\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/new-roots-4/","title":"New Roots part 4, Making it 127.0.0.1"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/new-roots-5/":{"body":"This is the fifth part of an ongoing series on configuring a new server. In our last post we discussed and configured some basic tools. For all intensive purposes, our 'root' system is complete. What we'll be doing now is building the infrastructure to run containers the way we want to.\nBefore we get around to setting things up, let's describe the what we're up to.\n\nCurrently, the only external service the server is running is ssh. We'd like our server to host more services. These services are likely to be both internal services like databases, and external services like HTTP/HTTPS hosts. Since the IPv4 space is increasingly crowded we'd like to do all of these things from one IPv4 address too.\nThere are lots of ways to provide isolation to these services. These include virtual machines through something like Xen, containers through something like Docker, or even just chroots. Isolation isn't just for security, it's one way to help increase your security somewhat but it isn't a silver bullet. Light solutions like containers have very little overhead though so the benefits tend to outweigh the costs.\nWe'll use containers, because they're entertaining and fun to use. This is a laboratory, remember? We're suposed to have fun and play with new things.\nOur First Container\nWe'll be using machinectl to work with our containers. You may already know Docker, CoreOS's rkt, or lxc, and you're more than welcome to use any of those. The important thing is to only use one on this machine. You don't want to be managing multiple container providers. Good news is they're all pretty much compatible with one another, so if you use machinectl you can still use Docker images.\nTo get started with our first container, we first need to construct one. We'll make a scratch directory and put it in there. We'll tell pacstrap, which came as part of arch-install-scripts, to ignore anything that's likely unnecessary in a container.\nmkdir -p ~/scratch/\necho -e \"n\\nn\\nn\\nn\\nn\\nn\\nn\\nn\\nn\\nn\\nn\\nn\\nn\\nn\\n\\n\" | sudo pacstrap -i -c -d ~/scratch/ base --ignore linux,linux-firmware,cryptsetup,jfsutils,lvm2,nano,netctl,reiserfsprogs,vi,xfsprogs,mdadm,device-mapper,licenses,man-pages,pcmciautils\n\nThis should give you an installed package size of under 400MB. That's pretty decent. We could probably go smaller but it doesn't really matter. We don't need to worry about setting up things like iptables since it's already protected via the host, and we don't need to have things like vi because we'll do our editing from outside of the container. We don't need things like linux because we're using the host kernel.\nTake a look in ~/scratch and you should see what appears to be a base Arch install like we had before. We're going to use chroot to enable some services by default, finally we're going to import it into machinectl:\ncd ~/scratch\ncat &lt;&lt;EOF | sudo chroot .\n    systemctl enable systemd-networkd\n    systemctl enable systemd-resolved\n    rm /etc/resolv.conf\n    ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf\n    sed -i -e 's/hosts: files dns myhostname/hosts: files mymachines resolve myhostname/g' /etc/nsswitch.conf\nEOF\nsudo tar --create --preserve-permissions --gzip * | sudo machinectl import-tar --read-only - base\n\nAfter a second, this command will be done and we'll have our first image. machinectl list-images shows this:\nNAME TYPE      RO  USAGE  CREATED                     MODIFIED\nbase subvolume yes 277.6M Wed 2016-05-11 15:52:43 PDT n/a     \n\n1 images listed.\n\nWe can test out the image with machinectl start base. If you get an \"Operation not supported\" error here it's because you updated your kernel and haven't restarted. Later we'll talk about kexec to help with this problem.\nYou can get a shell into the container with machinectl shell base. You'll probably notice there is no network connection. That's because our firewall is blocking us! You can check this by observing iptables -nvL and watching the packet counts go up on the icmp-port-unreachable filter.\nEditing our /etc/iptables/iptables.rules we can add the green lines:\n # Accept anything from the local loopback.\n --append INPUT --in-interface lo --jump ACCEPT\n+# Accept anything originating from a container.\n+--append INPUT --in-interface ve-+ --jump ACCEPT\n+--append FORWARD --in-interface ve-+ --jump ACCEPT\n\nThis rule will make it so any communications coming from our container adapters will be permitted accepted. Now reload the firewall with systemctl restart iptables.\nReturning to your container with machinectl reboot base then machinectl shell base, from here you should be able to run ping hoverbear.org and ping silicon if silicon is your machine's hostname like mine.\nYou can check over your work by running btrfs subvolume list / and verifying that there is a var/lib/machines/base subvolume, then running machinectl list-images --all and verifying there is a base image.\nFrom here you can create writable clones of the image with machinectl clone base $NAME, then start them, shell into them, and ultimately poweroff them. When you're ready to get rid of them entirely you can remove them.\nLater on you can upgrade your base image in a similar way.\nsudo machinectl clone base upgrade\nsudo machinectl start upgrade\n\nAfter a moment to start you can issue the upgrade command.\nsudo machinectl shell upgrade /bin/pacman -- -Syu\nsudo machinectl poweroff upgrade\n\nAfter another moment you can finish up.\nsudo machinectl remove base\nsudo machinectl read-only upgrade\nsudo machinectl rename upgrade base\nOrcestration\nAt this point you might have identified a potential problem coming up. How do we create and maintain all these gosh darn containers? Well, that's a great question! We're going to try using Puppet!\nThis is a very different strategy compared to that taken by Docker. Docker uses declarative Dockerfiles to build images, then you upgrade by either replacing the current running container, or executing commands via the run subcommand. With puppet we'll be able to easily execute pre-defined provisioning scripts and maintain our running containers.\nAlso, I want to learn Puppet, so this is a great excuse. You can review the Puppet docs as well as this guide by Digital Ocean. Our plan is a bit different than those.\nLet's start by creating a puppet container from our base.\nmachinectl clone base puppet\n\nSince we're basing our puppet image on our base Arch image we can have them share repository caches. Neat! Next we'll create a environments subvolume on our BTRFS volume so we can mount it into the puppet image. This will help us not accidently delete things. We're 'in' a subvolume already so we need to actually mount the true root for this.\nmount /dev/sda /mnt/\nbtrfs subvolume create /mnt/config/puppet\necho \"/dev/sda    /config/puppet             btrfs   subvol=config/puppet,rw,relatime,ssd,space_cache,compress=lzo          0   0\" &gt;&gt; /etc/fstab\nmkdir -p /config/puppet\nmount /config/puppet\n\nWe'll create /etc/systemd/nspawn/puppet.nspawn which is the container specific configuration.\nmkdir -p /etc/systemd/nspawn/\ncat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /etc/systemd/nspawn/puppet.nspawn\n[Files]\n# Official packages are signed and verified before install\nBind=/var/cache/pacman\n# abs packages are not.\nBindReadOnly=/var/cache/abs\n# Bind in our puppet configuration.\nBind=/config/puppet:/etc/puppetlabs\nEOF\n\n\nSee anti-feature note in next section.\n\nNow we can start the machine and hop inside.\nsudo machinectl start puppet\nsudo machinectl shell puppet\n\nInside of this container we can start seting up Puppet! First we'll install it:\npacman -Syu puppet --noconfirm\n\nBefore we start making manifests we need to get the server working though! In order to do this we need to edit our configuration file at /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf.\n# In puppet container\ncat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;&gt; /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf\n[main]\ncertname = puppet\nbindaddress = ::\nautosign = true\nenvironment = production\nruninterval = 1h\nstrict_variables = true\nEOF\n\nNext we'll make a simple .service file for puppet master since it doesn't come with one by default. You can run systemctl cat puppet to see the configuration of puppet agent. We'll basically just copy this.\ncat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /etc/systemd/system/puppetmaster.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Puppet master\nWants=basic.target\nAfter=basic.target network.target\n\n[Service]\nEnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/puppetmaster\nEnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/puppet\nEnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/puppet\nExecStart=/usr/bin/puppet master $PUPPET_EXTRA_OPTS --no-daemonize\nExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID\nKillMode=process\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nEOF\n\nNow you can start it with systemctl start puppetmaster. At this point let's consider that our puppet container should probably be managed by Puppet as well! Let's do that to learn how to use Puppet, then we'll figure out networking.\nmkdir -p /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/\ncat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/main.pp\nnode puppet,test {\n    file { 'puppet-test':\n        path    =&gt; '/puppet-test',\n        ensure  =&gt; file,\n        content =&gt; \"Hello. Hallo.\",\n        owner   =&gt; 'root',\n        mode    =&gt; '0644',\n    }\n}\nEOF\n\nNow you can run systemctl start puppet (this is the agent) and you might see that /puppet-test now exists. If not you might either need to wait a moment or restart puppet. This is due to the syncing behaivor which we can tame later.\nFinally run systemctl enable puppet and systemctl enable puppetmaster. Remember that you can edit this configuration from outside the container by editing the things in /puppet on the our root.\nAll we need to do now is add Puppet to our base. First make it writable with machinectl read-only base false, start it, then shell in with machinectl shell base.\npacman -Syu puppet --noconfirm\nsystemctl enable puppet\n\nThen poweroff it and mark it read only again with machinectl read-only base true. Now when we clone it the new containers will automatically run puppet.\nFixing an Anti-Feature\nA note, if you machinectl remove $MACHINE systemd will, in rather user hostile manner, delete your /etc/systemd/nspawn/$MACHINE.nspawn file, with no output, no warning, or flag to disable this anti-feature.\nSo let's fix it! In fact, we can make our /etc/sytemd/network/ and /etc/systemd/nspawn folders both subvolumes for safe keeping. With config/puppetlabs/ also as subvolume our primary container configuration will be stored safely in subvolumes.\nReviewing btrfs subvolume list / you may notice that our machines have been creating subvolumes as they go. This is great. We can use these for snapshots later. We'll create a config/network and config/nspawn. Recall that we're 'in' a subvolume already so we need to actually mount the true root for this again.\nmount /dev/sda /mnt/\nbtrfs subvolume create /mnt/config/network\nbtrfs subvolume create /mnt/config/nspawn\ncat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;&gt; /etc/fstab\n/dev/sda    /config/nspawn      btrfs   subvol=config/nspawn,rw,relatime,ssd,space_cache,compress=lzo   0   0\n/dev/sda    /config/network     btrfs   subvol=config/network,rw,relatime,ssd,space_cache,compress=lzo   0   0\n# Read only so nothing gets deleted.\n/dev/sda    /etc/systemd/nspawn btrfs   subvol=config/nspawn,ro,relatime,ssd,space_cache,compress=lzo   0   0\n/dev/sda    /etc/systemd/network btrfs   subvol=config/network,ro,relatime,ssd,space_cache,compress=lzo   0   0\nEOF\nmkdir -p /config/nspawn\nmkdir -p /config/network\nmount /config/nspawn\nmount /config/network\n# Remount the folders.\ncp -r /etc/systemd/nspawn/* /config/nspawn/ &amp;&amp; rm -r /etc/systemd/nspawn/*\ncp -r /etc/systemd/network/* /config/network/ &amp;&amp; rm -r /etc/systemd/network/*\nmount /etc/systemd/network\nmount /etc/systemd/nspawn\n\nGreat. Try touch /etc/systemd/nspawn/web.puppet, you can't! Instead, you can touch /config/nspawn/web.puppet.\nInter-Container Networking\nRight now if you start up base and try to ping puppet from it things it won't work. You can observe the differences in their IP addresses. Mine were 169.254.143.177/16 and 169.254.221.43/16 which are on different subnets. We need some what to bring them together.\nI tried a few ways of doing this (actually spent 6 days trying different ideas) and ended up on this because it's the simplest and seems easiest to understand.\nFirst we'll go ahead and create a bridge. A bridge will let us join all the containers together on a single network so they can resolve each others names. For now this is sufficient, though there is some documentation suggestion VLANs can be used to improve this system. Perhaps we'll explore that later.\nOn our 'root' host:\ncat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /config/network/br-internal.netdev\n[NetDev]\nName=br-internal\nKind=bridge\nDescription=The internal network bridge.\nEOF\n\ncat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /config/network/br-internal.network\n[Match]\nName=br-internal\n\n[Network]\nDescription=The internal network bridge.\nDHCP=yes\nEOF\n\nmachinectl read-only base false\ncat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /var/lib/machines/base/etc/systemd/network/internal.network\n[Match]\nName=int-*\n\n[Network]\nDescription=The internal network connecting containers.\nDHCP=yes\nEOF\nmachinectl read-only base true\n\nThen run systemctl edit systemd-nspawn@ and enter the following:\n[Service]\n# Set up.\nExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c \"ip link add int-$(echo %I | cut -c 1-11) type veth peer name con-$(echo %I | cut -c 1-11)\"\nExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c \"ip link set con-$(echo %I | cut -c 1-11) master br-internal\"\nExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c \"ip link set con-$(echo %I | cut -c 1-11) up\"\n# Do work\nExecStart=\nExecStart=/bin/sh -c \"systemd-nspawn --quiet --keep-unit --boot --link-journal=try-guest --network-veth --network-interface=int-$(echo %I | cut -c 1-11) --settings=override --machine=%I\"\n# Tear down.\nExecStopPost=-/bin/sh -c \"ip link delete con-$(echo %I | cut -c 1-11)\"\n\nTry issuing machinectl clone base test machinectl poweroff test puppet, machinectl start test puppet, then try running machinectl shell test and see if you can ping puppet. Finally make sure you can ping hoverbear.org. If all is well then we've had great success.\nAt this point if you start up both the puppet and test container you should find a /puppet-test file on both. You can verify things with systemctl status puppet.\nThe Upgrade Problem\nEarlier you made have already run into this problem, but if we run pacman -Syu and the linux package on the 'root' container gets upgraded this can cause some problems for us in the long haul. This may manifest as \"Operation Not Permitted\" errors when using tools like ip, this is because the kernel is trying to access modules on the file system which no longer exist.\nWe can use a tool called kexec to quickly (and uncleanly) switch to the new kernel. On my server this takes about a third of the time compared to actually rebooting. It's important to note that this doesn't replace a reboot though, as it doesn't make efforts to clean up anything. Things may go funky, and you may still need to reboot.\nWe'll build a systemd unit for this then enable it like so:\npacman -S kexec-tools\ncat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /etc/systemd/system/kexec-load@.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Load %i as the kernel.\nDocumentation=man:kexec(8)\nDefaultDependencies=no\nBefore=shutdown.target umount.target final.target\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/usr/bin/kexec -l /boot/vmlinuz-%i --initrd=/boot/initramfs-%i.img --reuse-cmdline\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=kexec.target\nEOF\nsystemctl enable kexec-load@linux\n\nNow you can load into the newest kernel with systemctl kexec when you decide it's time. I'd suggest testing it now before moving on so you know it works! This also works great as a soft reboot.\nThe Web Proxy\nSince we know we'd like to host be able to host multiple web services we'll need to set up a proxy to handle port 80, the default socket for httpd. Since only one program can bind to a given port at a time, its job will be to inspect the incoming traffic to observe the Server Name Indentification, or SNI, then route it to the appropriate container. By default this will be the web-$VARIABLE container, where the request is $VARIABLE.$DOMAIN.$TLD. We'll call the proxy itself web.\n[network: example.hoverbear.org]-&gt;[web]-&gt;[web-example]\n\nLater we'll follow a similar scheme for db, usr, box, etc. You can use whichever scheme you'd like, or change later, just be consistent.\nWe'll start by editing our puppet configuration to define what this host should look like. Since we have the puppet configuration subvolume mounted on /puppet on our host we can just edit it from there.\nmkdir -p /config/puppet/code/modules/web/files/\ncat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /config/puppet/code/modules/web/files/haproxy.cfg\nglobal\n    user haproxy\n    group haproxy\n    daemon\n\ndefaults\n    timeout client 10s\n    timeout server 10s\n    timeout connect 10s\n\nfrontend unsecured\n    bind *:80\n    mode http\n    log /dev/log local0 info\n    # Wait for delay on HELO\n    tcp-request inspect-delay 5s\n    # Redirect\n    redirect scheme https code 301\n\nfrontend secured\n    bind *:443\n    mode tcp\n    option tcplog\n    log /dev/log local0 info\n    # Wait for delay on HELO\n    tcp-request inspect-delay 5s\n    tcp-request content accept if { req.ssl_hello_type 1 }\n    # Figure out which backend (= container) to use\n    use_backend silicon_host if { req_ssl_sni -i silicon.hoverbear.org }\n\nbackend silicon_host\n    mode tcp\n    option tcplog\n    log /dev/log local0 info\n    # Pass it along\n    option ssl-hello-chk\n    server web-silicon web-silicon:443 check\nEOF\nmkdir -p /config/puppet/code/environments/production/manifests/\ncat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /config/puppet/code/environments/production/manifests/main.pp\nnode web {\n    file { 'haproxy.cfg':\n        path    =&gt; '/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg',\n        ensure  =&gt; file,\n        source =&gt; 'puppet:///modules/web/haproxy.cfg',\n        owner   =&gt; 'root',\n        mode    =&gt; '0644',\n    }\n    package { 'haproxy':\n        ensure =&gt; installed,\n        before =&gt; File['haproxy.cfg'],\n    }\n    service { 'haproxy':\n        ensure    =&gt; running,\n        subscribe =&gt; File['haproxy.cfg'],\n    }\n}\nEOF\n\nWe can set up the container to bind to our host ports 80 and 443.\ncat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /config/nspawn/web.nspawn\n[Network]\nPort=80\nPort=443\nEOF\n\nThen add in our firewall rules to the /etc/iptables/iptables.rules file, and reboot iptables.\n # Allow SSH connections.\n --append TCP --protocol tcp --dport 22 --jump ACCEPT\n # Allow HTTP connections.\n+--append TCP --protocol tcp --dport 80 --jump ACCEPT\n # Allow HTTPS connections.\n+--append TCP --protocol tcp --dport 443 --jump ACCEPT\n\n\nFinally we can create the machine:\nmachinectl clone base web\nmachinectl start web\n\nGive it a few seconds then try running systemctl status haproxy -M web.\nGotcha: Sometimes puppet doesn't wait for the name resolution to configure and needs to be restarted with systemctl restart puppet -M web. I'm currently pondering solutions to this.\n\n        That looks great.\n        \n    \nRest and Test\nSince the hostname is silicon.hoverbear.org is already mapped in DNS for me, I'll use that for testing. You want to make your container web-$SUBDOMAIN.\nmachinectl clone base web-silicon\nmachinectl start web-silicon\n\nSince we're testing we don't need to be clean at all. Just shell in, pacman -Syu nginx openssl and edit the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf on that container according to this diff:\n-listen       80;\n+listen       [::]:443 ssl;\n+ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt;\n+ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key;\n\nThen generate the certificate with:\nmkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl\nopenssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt\n\nThen start up the nginx service on that container. Verify you can curl web-silicon from both the container itself and your web container. You can check systemctl status -M web-silicon nginx and systemctl status -M web haproxy for any messages.\nWith any luck, you'll see the nginx default web page.\nIf all is good you can make these machines default to running with machinectl enable web puppet. In our next post we'll get around to setting more refined web service. Remember, web-silicon was just a hello world.\nSystem Evolution\nOver time our system will inevitably change, grow, and decay. We've been spending time to make sure that whatever happens we'll have the tools to keep going. We haven't gone out of our way to over-engineer anything so far, we've just made what we need with a few sharp tools.\nAs we keep moving ahead we'll discover more needs and eventually build up our services to be better and stronger as a whole, but for now we have the basis to start our work. nspawn containers are persistent, but we can remove them whenever we want and re-create them with a new configuration. Our Puppet master will re-configure new images the same as old ones, and what we extend out with that can be retroactively applied to all. The key is for us to maintain a persisting copy of the data necessary in a safe space. BTRFS and the Bind= option of nspawn enable this.\nIn our next post we'll explore how to deploy a basic folder based nginx host and the RustFestEU Call for Papers site. Then, it'll go live! Whoa! But first, let's take a break. That post was so long!\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/new-roots-5/","title":"New Roots part 5, Erecting Container Infrastructure"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/on-c51/":{"body":"I've been following the story about the proposed bill C-51 for a couple weeks now. When the Conservatives introduced the bill I was quite unimpressed with it's lack of oversight, among other things I heard and read about it. I expected it would change due to opposition, so I did not look much further into it.\nWhen the Liberals decided they would support the bill I was suprised, but was busy with midterms, so did not get a chance to look more deeply into the content of the bill. But I couldn't help but be reminded of what Trudeau said about the attack on Parliment months ago:\n\nWe are a proud democracy, a welcoming and peaceful nation and a country of open arms and open hearts. We are a nation of fairness, of justice and of the rule of law. We will not be intimidated into changing that. If anything, these are the values and principles to which we must hold on even tighter.\nOur dedication to democracy and to the institutions we have built is the foundation of our society and a continued belief in both will guide us correctly into the future. Staying true to our values in a time of crisis will make us an example to the world.\nCriminals cannot and will not dictate to us how we act as a nation, how we govern ourselves or how we treat each other. They cannot and will not dictate our values, and they do not get to decide how we use our shared public spaces.\n\n\nMidterms are over now and I've been thinking a bit more about the bill. Today I read this op-ed in the Times Colonist from one of our local MPs, Murray Rankin. I agree with many of his opinions on the matter.\nCSIS, and it's cousin CSEC already carry out and support considerable signals and cryptographic intelligence. In fact, Canada is one of the \"Five Eyes\", the largest and most powerful signals intelligence group in the world.\nOne prominent former NSA official has [warned us](](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/edward-snowden-urges-caution-over-ottawas-proposed-security-law/article22755515/) against the government using \"Fear and Panic\" to set up secret powers. We saw similar measures in the US with the Patriot Act, and it's affects are still being felt by everyone, not just activists, through the various NSA spying programs violating everyone's right to privacy.\nThe Anishinabek First Nation has expressed concerns over the bill. Grand Chief Terrance Nelson has cited that he is worried that under these new laws  peaceful protests like \"Idle No More\" could be targetted and \"disrupted.\"\nWith luck, this will become an election issue and we will get a chance for a meaningful, public debate about spying and cybersecurity.\n\nThere is a Town Hall with Victoria MP Murray Rankin and Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca MP Randall Garrison tomorrow.

If you change the configuration make sure to restart it.\n/etc/init.d/dropbear restart\n\nHowever if you attempt to ssh root@localhost -p 2222 you'll see a something along the lines of ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer. That's because the firewall is blocking it.\nNow in /etc/config/firewall we can add a rule to fix this:\n# ... Other Rules ...\n\n# Allow SSH on wan\nconfig rule\n        option src              wan\n        option proto            tcp\n        option dest_port        22\n        option target           ACCEPT\n\nThen restart the firewall:\n/etc/init.d/firewall restart\n\nNow you should be able to run ssh root@localhost -2222 on the host machine and connect.\nGoing Headless\nMake sure you've set up SSH (and logged in!) first before trying this.\nYou can stop the VM and start it again in a headless form.\nStop the VM:\nVBoxManage controlvm $VMNAME poweroff\n\nStart it headless:\nVBoxManage startvm $VMNAME --type headless\nGuest Additions\nUnfortunately it seems OpenWRT does not provide simple workflow for VirtualBox Guest Additions. Please let me know if you find a way of getting this working.\nLAN\nTo set up the other adapters, remove the lan section from the /etc/config/network file and replace it with:\nconfig interface 'lan1'\n    option ifname 'eth0'\n    option proto 'static'\n    option ipaddr '192.168.1.1'\n    option netmask '255.255.255.0'\n    option ip6assign '60'\n\nconfig interface 'lan2'\n    option ifname 'eth1'\n    option proto 'static'\n    option ipaddr '192.168.2.1'\n    option netmask '255.255.255.0'\n    option ip6assign '60'\n\nconfig interface 'lan3'\n    option ifname 'eth2'\n    option proto 'static'\n    option ipaddr '192.168.3.1'\n    option netmask '255.255.255.0'\n    option ip6assign '60'\n\nThen restart the network:\n/etc/init.d/network reload\nDHCP\nSince we removed the lan interface above, you'll need to reconfigure the DHCP daemon. Remove the lan block from /etc/config/dhcp and replace it with this:\nconfig dhcp 'lan1'\n    option interface 'lan1'\n    option start '100'\n    option limit '150'\n    option leasetime '12h'\n    option dhcpv6 'server'\n    option ra 'server'\n    list 'dhcp_option' '3,192.168.1.1'\n\nconfig dhcp 'lan2'\n    option interface 'lan2'\n    option start '100'\n    option limit '150'\n    option leasetime '12h'\n    option dhcpv6 'server'\n    option ra 'server'\n    list 'dhcp_option' '3,192.168.2.1'\n\nconfig dhcp 'lan3'\n    option interface 'lan3'\n    option start '100'\n    option limit '150'\n    option leasetime '12h'\n    option dhcpv6 'server'\n    option ra 'server'\n    list 'dhcp_option' '3,192.168.3.1'\n\nThen restart the dhcp and dnsmasq services.\n/etc/init.d/odhcpd reload\n/etc/init.d/dnsmasq reload\nFirewall\nThis new configuration won't work without modifying the firewall, too. Change the lan zone in /etc/config/firewall to:\nconfig zone\n    option name             lan\n    list   network          'lan1'\n    list   network          'lan2'\n    list   network          'lan3'\n    option input            ACCEPT\n    option output           ACCEPT\n    option forward          ACCEPT\n\nThen restart the firewall.\n\t/etc/init.d/firewall reload\nMaking Clients\nWe can create other VMs which attach to our new router.\nI'll be writing later about how to get these subordinates, (ahem, network clients) working together with the router.\nSee next post.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/openwrt-in-virtualbox/","title":"OpenWRT in Virtualbox"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/openwrt-qos/":{"body":"Using the setup from my last two posts, let's play with some QoS parameters and observe the results.\n\nThe documentation for OpenWRT's QoS is rather lacking, please feel encouraged to improve it as you go!\n\nPrerequisites\nDocumented here, the qos-scripts package offers a simple configuration that integrates well with the rest of OpenWRT's UCI (Unified Configuration Interface).\nOn the router:\nopkg install qos-scripts\n\nAs an added side benefit, qos-scripts will pull in several dependencies that can be used to further tune our QoS.\nOverview\nYou can look into /etc/config/qos to see the default configuration.\nYou'll see several config block types. Let's take a look at samples.\nInterfaces\nconfig interface wan\n    option classgroup  \"Default\"\n    option enabled      0\n    option upload       128\n    option download     1024\n\nThis is an interface definition for wan. wan is defined in /etc/config/network.\n\noption classgroup \"Default\" defines that we'll use the classes defined in the config classgroup \"Default\" block also in the configuration file.\noption enabled 0 defines that QoS is currently not enabled for the wan interface. Meaning this configuration currently doesn't do anything. If it's value was 1 it would be enabled.\noption upload 128 defines that this interface should only be able to upload at a rate of 128 kilobits/second. (Only for TCP)\noption download 1024 defines that this interface should only be able to download at a rate of 1024 kilobits/second.\n\nRules\nconfig classify\n    option target       \"Priority\"\n    option ports        \"22,53\"\n    option comment      \"ssh, dns\"\nconfig classify\n    option target       \"Normal\"\n    option proto        \"tcp\"\n    option ports        \"20,21,25,80,110,443,993,995\"\n    option comment      \"ftp, smtp, http(s), imap\"\nconfig reclassify\n    option target       \"Priority\"\n    option proto        \"icmp\"\nconfig default\n    option target       \"Bulk\"\n    option portrange    \"1024-65535\"\n\nclassify blocks are an initial, connection-tracked classification. They are only run on connections which have not been assigned a traffic class already.\nreclassify blocks can override the class on a per packet basis without altering the connection's classification.\ndefault blocks are fallbacks for everything that has not been marked by a classify or reclassify.\n\noption target \"Priority\" means that any connections or packets under this block are placed in the specified class (in the interface's classgroup).\noption ports \"22,53\" means that this classifier will only work for connections on port 22 and 53.\noption comment \"ssh,dns\" is a comment about the purpose of the classifier.\noption proto \"tcp\" defines the protocol (tcp, udp, icmp, etc) that this classifier matches.\noption pktsize \"-500\" allows us to define a packetsize to match.\n\nIf you're wondering, the - in -500 operates I think, on the definition of the corresponding class.\nClassgroups\nconfig classgroup \"Default\"\n\toption classes      \"Priority Express Normal Bulk\"\n    option default      \"Normal\"\n\nclassgroup blocks are used to define different class groupings. This is only really useful if you wish to have multiple interfaces with different class considerations, for example, you might want eth1 to have an ultrapriority class or something.\nClasses\nconfig class \"Priority\"\n    option packetsize  400\n    option avgrate     10\n    option priority    20\nconfig class \"Express\"\n    option packetsize  1000\n    option avgrate     50\n    option priority    10\nconfig class \"Normal\"\n    option packetsize  1500\n    option packetdelay 100\n    option avgrate     10\n    option priority    5\nconfig class \"Bulk\"\n    option avgrate     1\n    option packetdelay 200\n\nclass blocks are used to define packet classes. Each class is placed inside of a seperate bucket.\n\noption packetsize 400 defines the size of packets within the bucket.\noption maxsize 1000 defines the maximum size of the bucket. (Probably, this isn't specified.)\noption packetdelay 100 defines the delay of the packet, in ms.\noption avgrate 50 defines some undocumented parameter in %.\noption priority 20 is a percentile value specifying the bucket's priority.\n\nInitial Configuration\nAs a reminder, here is the configuration of our setup.\n\n        Our setup.\n        \n    \nFirst, we need to pull in xt_connmark, which is a depedency for some features of qos-scripts:\nmodprobe xt_connmark\n\nThen, in /etc/config/qos replace the wan interface with our various defined interfaces with some modest and determinable differences to test that it works.\n# INTERFACES:\n# Fast client.\nconfig interface lan1\n        option classgroup  \"Default\"\n        option enabled      1\n        option upload       256\n        option download     2048\n# Slow client. (1/2 speed)\nconfig interface lan2\n        option classgroup  \"Default\"\n        option enabled      1\n        option upload       128\n        option download     1024\n# The Host. (Big pipes)\nconfig interface lan3\n        option classgroup  \"Default\"\n        option enabled      1\n        option upload       4096\n        option download     4096\n\nTo enable QoS and start it:\n/etc/init.d/qos enable\n/etc/init.d/qos start\n\nLater, to restart it:\n/etc/init.d/qos restart\nAside: An Resolved Issue\n\nWhen I attempted to use the pktsize option in a classifier I recieved yet unresolved errors.\n\nThe error was:\niptables: No chain/target/match by that name.\n\nInspecting the generated config:\n/usr/lib/qos/generate.sh all\n\nSee the script executed along with output (for diagnosing errors):\n/usr/lib/qos/generate.sh all | sh -x\n\nResulted in:\n# ...\n+ iptables -t mangle -A qos_Default -m mark --mark 0/0xf0 -p udp -m length --length 500 -j MARK --set-mark 34/0xff\niptables: No chain/target/match by that name.\n# ...\n\nI was only able to resolve this by removing the use of pktsize in classifiers then restarting the service.\nTesting It\nOpen up a terminal to use vagrant ssh test1 and test2 then, run the following command at approximately the same time (remember to sub in $TEST3IP):\nwget $TEST3IP/video.mp4\n\nYou should see something like the following:\n\n        In action.\n        \n    \nFeel free to cancel them at any time. We only care about the rate right now.\nAs you can see, test1 recieved approximately twice the bandwidth of test2. Perfect, that's exactly what we wanted.\n\nThings will not always be exact as there are protocol overheads and other factors in our simulation.\n\nBefore going on to more complicated experiments you may want to ensure that the rates are more fair.\nExperimentation\nWith our QoS system in place, what kind of experiments can we do to the network?\nFavoring Ports\nLooking over the default configuration you can see the following config block:\nconfig classify\n    option target       \"Priority\"\n    option ports        \"22,53\"\n    option comment      \"ssh, dns\"\n\nWhich match to the following class:\nconfig class \"Priority\"\n    option packetsize  400\n    option avgrate     10\n    option priority    20\n\nThis suggests that all traffic over port 22 (The standard ssh default) will prioritized as it has the highest priority in the default configuration.\nBut what if you don't use port 22 for ssh? Then this is a silly rule.  You can easily just remap the ports option to \"2222,53\" or something else.\nLimiting a Class Rate\nSay we'd like to gaurentee that one class of packets can only take up so much of the total limit of the connection.\nFirst, lets get our test3 VM serving off multiple ports so we can classify them differently.\nIn /etc/nginx/nginx.conf modify your listen block:\n    server {\n      listen       80 default_server;\n      listen       8080; # Add this.\n      server_name  localhost;\n      root /vagrant;\n      # ...\n\nThen run sudo systemctl restart nginx.\nBack on the router, edit /etc/config/qos to add two new blocks, a classify block and a class block. Also make sure that your lan1 and lan2 interfaces have the same upload and download so we can use them to test.\nconfig classify\n\toption target  \"httpdev\"\n    option ports   \"8080\"\n    option comment \"httpdev\"\nconfig class \"httpdev\"\n\toption packetsize  1500\n    option packetdelay 100\n    option limitrate   10\n    option priority    5\n\nThen in the classroup \"Default\" add httpdev to the classes.\nFinally, restart the QoS:\n/etc/init.d/qos reload\n\nThen get test1 to download from port 80, and test2 to download from port 8080.\n\n        httpdev\n        \n    \nAttempting to download on port 8080 only resulted in recieving 10% of the available bandwidth, where on port 80 it was able to use the entire link.\nPriorities\nInstead of placing a hard limit on the rate a class can achieve, let's instead change the priority it recieves.\nOn the router, edit /etc/config/qos, change the Normal class to have a 50 priority, while leaving httpdev on 5.\nconfig class \"Normal\"\n    option packetsize  1500\n    option packetdelay 100\n    option avgrate     10\n    option priority    50\n\nThen issue /etc/init.d/qos reload. To test this, on one of the test1 or test2 open two connections and attempt to download from both ports.\n\n        Priorities.\n        \n    \nHere I ran two tests, one with downloads on different ports, one with them on the same. Notice how the 8080 download is much slower while there is a download on port 80 happening, but while both at on port 80 they're nearly the same (except that I couldn't stop both at the same time so the second one I stopped was reading higher then before, they were both in the teens).\nA lone download on port 8080 (and thus of the httpdev class) would still be fast if there is no other traffic in the normal class, though.\nFurther Configuration\nWhile qos-scripts provides many simplier facilities for configuring Quality-of-Service in OpenWRT, it is certainly not the be all, end all.\nYou can also take a much more low-level and fine grained control of how things behave using standard Linux tools. After all, everything in qos-scripts is built off iptables, tc, and other standard tools.\nHere are some links to explore further:\n\nNetwork Traffic Control - Configuring your kernel scheduler.\nNetfilter - Configuring iptables and other things.\nBandwidth Monitoring - Keeping tabs on things.\n\nA special thanks to the Bergens Banen train for our test material. The cover image of this article is from the video.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/openwrt-qos/","title":"OpenWRT QoS"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/option-monads-in-rust/":{"body":"One common monadic structure is the Option (or Maybe in Haskell and other languages) type. This can be seen as an encapsulation type. Consider a function which may fail to produce a meaningful value for certain inputs. For example,\nfn main () {\n  // Parses a string into an integer.\n  from_str::&lt;int&gt;(\"4\"); // A valid input.\n  from_str::&lt;int&gt;(\"Potato\"); // Definitely invalid.\n}\n\nThe from_str function cannot return a meaningful value for \"Potato\". Rust (and many other functional languages) does not have null, so what should we return? This is where an Option type becomes useful. In our example, instead of returning an int type, the from_str function returns an Option&lt;int&gt; type.\nIn Rust, the Option enum is represented by either Some(x) or None, where x is the encapsulated value. In this way, the Option monad can be thought of like a box. It encapsulates the value x, where x is any type. Rust defines an Option as such, where &lt;T&gt; and (T) denote that it handles a generic type, meaning that T could be an int, a str, a vec, or anything else, even other Option types.\nenum Option&lt;T&gt; { None, Some(T) }\nValue In, Value Out\nSince we can see an Option as a box, or encapsulation type, we need to be able to put things into the box, or take things out.\nPutting a value into an Option is delightfully simple. Simply use Some(x) or None in place of x or (an imaginary) null. Most of the time, you will receive or return an Option based on input, rather than just creating them directly. Here are some examples of different techniques.\nfn main () {\n    // Ways to create an Option containing an int.\n    let w = Some(3i); // Something\n    let x: Option&lt;int&gt; = None; // Nothing\n    // Receive from function.\n    let y = some_on_even(2); // Something\n    let z = some_on_even(3); // Nothing\n}\n\nfn some_on_even(val: int) -&gt; Option&lt;int&gt; {\n    match val {\n        // Matches an even number.\n        x if x % 2 == 0 =&gt; Some(x),\n        // Matches anything else.\n        _                     =&gt; None\n    }\n}\n\nTo take something out of the Option we need to be able to extract, or \"unwrap\" the value. There are a number of ways to do this. Some common methods are with a match or .expect().\n\nIf you're seeking to write code that won't crash, avoid .expect() and it's cousin .unwrap() and use safer alternatives like unwrap_or_default() or unwrap_or().\n\nfn main () {\n    // Create an Option containing the value 1.\n    let a_monad: Option&lt;int&gt; = Some(1);\n    // Extract and branch based on result.\n    let value_from_match = match a_monad {\n        Some(x) =&gt; x,\n        None    =&gt; 0i // A fallback value.\n    };\n    // Extract with failure message.\n    let value_from_expect = a_monad.expect(\"No result.\");\n    // Extract, or get a default value\n    let value_or_default = a_monad.unwrap_or_default();\n    let value_or_fallback = a_monad.unwrap_or(42i);\n}\nNot Just a Null\nBy now, you're probably asking yourself something similar to the following:\n\nSo why not just have null? What does an Option monad provide that's more?\n\nThat's a very good question. What are the benefits of this paradigm?\n\nYou must handle all possible returns, or lack thereof. The compiler will emit errors if you don't appropriately handle an Option. You can't just forget to handle the None (or 'null') case.\nNull doesn't exist. It's immediately apparent to readers and consumers which functions might not return a meaningful value. Attempting to use a value from an Option without handling it results in a compiler error.\nValues aren't boxed. Option values don't wrap pointers, they wrap values. In order to have a null, you necessarily need a pointer. (Thanks cmr!)\nComposition becomes easy. The Option monad becomes much more powerful when it is used in composition, as its characteristics allow for pipelines to be created which don't need to explicitly handle errors at each step.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the composition idea...\nComposing a Symphony of Functions\nNirvana is being able to compose a series of functions together without introducing a tight dependency between them, such that they could be moved or changed without needing to be concerned with how this might affect the other functions. For example, let's say we have some functions with the following signatures:\nfn log(value: f64)     -&gt; f64; // This could fail. (log(-2) == ??)\nfn sqrt(value: f64)    -&gt; f64; // This could fail. (sqrt(-2) == ??)\nfn square(value: f64)  -&gt; f64;\nfn double(value: f64)  -&gt; f64;\nfn inverse(value: f64) -&gt; f64;\n\nQuite the little math library we have here! How about we come up with a way to turn 20 into something else, using a round-about pipeline?\nsqrt(-1 * (log(-1 * (20 * 2)))^2)\n\nWith our little library it'd look something like this:\n// This code will not compile, it's invalid.\n// `Null` isn't a real type in Rust.\nfn main () {\n    let number: f64 = 20.;\n    match log(inverse(double(number))) {\n        x =&gt; {\n            match sqrt(square(inverse(x)))) {\n                y =&gt; println!(\"The result is {}\", y),\n                Null =&gt; println!(\".sqrt failed.\")\n            }\n        },\n        Null =&gt; println!(\".log failed.\")\n    }\n}\n\nIn this case, we had two functions which could fail, since we didn't have an Option type, the author must be aware of and handle possible Null values. Note that the onus was on the programmer to know when a Null might be returned, and remember to handle it, not on the compiler.\nLet's see what the same code would look like using the Option monad. In this example, all of the functions are appropriately defined.\nfn main () {\n    let number: f64 = 20.;\n    // Perform a pipeline of options.\n    let result = Some(number)\n        .map(inverse) // Described below.\n        .map(double)\n        .map(inverse)\n        .and_then(log) // Described below.\n        .map(square)\n        .and_then(sqrt);\n    // Extract the result.\n    match result {\n        Some(x) =&gt; println!(\"Result was {}.\", x),\n        None    =&gt; println!(\"This failed.\")\n    }\n}\n// You can ignore these.\nfn log(value: f64) -&gt; Option&lt;f64&gt; {\n    match value.log2() {\n        x if x.is_normal() =&gt; Some(x),\n        _                  =&gt; None\n    }\n}\nfn sqrt(value: f64) -&gt; Option&lt;f64&gt; {\n    match value.sqrt() {\n        x if x.is_normal() =&gt; Some(x),\n        _                  =&gt; None\n    }\n}\nfn double(value: f64) -&gt; f64 {\n    value * 2.\n}\nfn square(value: f64) -&gt; f64 {\n    value.powi(2 as i32)\n}\nfn inverse(value: f64) -&gt; f64 {\n    value * -1.\n}\n\nThis code handles all possible result branches cleanly, and the author need not explicitly deal with each possible None result, they only need to handle the end result. If any of the functions which may fail (called by and_then()) do fail, the rest of the computation is bypassed. Additionally, it makes expressing and understanding the pipeline of computations much easier.\nmap and and_then (along with a gamut of other functions listed here) provide a robust set of tools for composing functions together. Let's take a look, their signatures are below.\nfn map&lt;U&gt;     (self, f: |T| -&gt; U)         -&gt; Option&lt;U&gt;\nfn and_then&lt;U&gt;(self, f: |T| -&gt; Option&lt;U&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;U&gt;\nFunctor Interface: .map()\nmap provides a way to apply a function of the signature |T| -&gt; U to an Option&lt;T&gt;, returning an Option&lt;U&gt;. This is ideal for functions like double() which don't return an Option.\nThis call corresponds to fmap in Haskell, which is part of a functor. Monads have this trait because every monad is a functor.\nMonad Interface: .and_then()\nand_then allows you to apply a |T| -&gt; Option&lt;U&gt; function to an Option&lt;T&gt;, returning an Option&lt;U&gt;. This allows for functions which may return no value, like sqrt(), to be applied.\nThis call corresponds to bind in Haskell and theoretical Monad definitions. Meanwhile unwrapping Some&lt;T&gt; or None is the equivalent of return. (Thanks to dirkt)\nExamples\nWorking with Options in Vectors. Parsing a vector of strings into integers. Note that Rust's iterators are lazy, so if collect() isn't called, the iterator itself could be composed with others.\nfn main () {\n    let strings = vec!(\"4\", \"12\", \"foo\", \"15\", \"bar\", \"baz\", \"1\");\n    let numbers: Vec&lt;int&gt; = strings.iter()\n        // `filter_map` transforms `Vec&lt;&amp;'static str&gt;` to `Vec&lt;int&gt;`\n        // Any `None` will be removed,\n        // while any `Some` will be unwrapped.\n        .filter_map(|&amp;x| from_str::&lt;int&gt;(x))\n        // `collect` forces iteration through the lazy iterator.\n        .collect();\n    println!(\"{}\", numbers);\n}\n\nA simple pipeline.

This means this is not possible:\nfn impossible(val: bool) {}\nfn impossible(val: bool, other: bool) {}\nfn impossible(val: bool, rest: bool...) {}\n\nComing from languages such as JS or Ruby, you might miss this functionality. In particular, I found myself often looking for a way to have an optional configuration or value I pass in.\n// In the context of an configuration structure for a client:\nclient.connect(\"127.0.0.1\")?;\nclient.connect(\"127.0.0.1\", custom_config)?;\n\n\nNote on scope: I'm not interested in writing about how to deal with variadic arguments at this time. If you are insatiable about this, try it yourself, consider a macro, reference format!().\n\nJust Throw Another Function At It!\nSince that's not possible, what's a viable alternative?\nThe most obvious is to have two functions. There is nothing technically wrong with that. It's perfectly reasonable, and results in a very acceptable API. There is no tricks, and it's understandable immediately:\nfn connect(addr: String) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, io::Error&gt; {\n    Self::connect_with_config(addr, Config::default())\n}\n\nfn connect_with_config(addr: String, config: Config) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, io::Error&gt; {\n    // ...\n}\n\nBut this is a very specific example. There are sometimes general cases where this is not as reasonable. For example, let's say we have a send message that usually takes a payload, but supports no payload (for pings, for example). At this point the technique just looks strange, you either end up with message_with_payload() everywhere, a ping() function, or a message_without_payload() function. Using your imagination you might be able to think of other examples in your own code where you've encountered this.\nWe've got Options\nThe next logical step, which starts to harness Rust's abstractions, is using an optional type.\nfn message(addr: String, maybe_payload: Option&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;u64, io::Error&gt; {\n    // ...\n    if let Some(payload) = maybe_payload {\n        // Off you go...\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n// Using it:\nmessage(\"127.0.0.1\", Some(vec![1,2,3]))?;\nmessage(\"127.0.0.1\", None)?;\n\nThis certainly gets the job done! Now we can have one function that can internally handle if the value is provided or not. It does clutter up the API a bit, but it seems now we have these odd feeling Some(_) and None variants loitering around.\nWe boil the problem down with some generics, to get a better idea of what we're trying to accomplish and to support some microbenchmarks.\nfn value_arg&lt;Thing&gt;(thing: Thing) -&gt; Thing {\n    thing\n}\n\nfn optional_arg&lt;Thing&gt;(thing: Option&lt;Thing&gt;) -&gt; Thing\nwhere Thing: Default {\n    thing.unwrap_or(Thing::default())\n}\n\nAs you can see, these are deliberately as simple as we can possibly make them while not allowing it to be optimized away, they return their value and allow the bencher to accept their output.\nLet's get rid of the Some(_). We can use generics via impl Trait, inline generic, or where clauses.\nAside: Why I like impl Trait\nI think it enables a more succinct style, better semantics for some use cases, and helps avoid one particular usability mistake that is easy to make. Consider the following:\nfn handles_a_pair_of_stringish&lt;Stringish&gt;(first: Stringish, second: Stringish)\nwhere Stringish: AsRef&lt;str&gt; {\n    // ...\n}\n\nfn handles_a_pair_of_varying_stringish(first: impl AsRef&lt;str&gt;, second: impl AsRef&lt;str&gt;) {\n    // ...\n}\n\n\n#[test]\nfn send_stringishes_of_difference_type() {\n    handles_a_pair_of_stringish(\"foo\".to_string(), \"foo\"); // This won't compile!\n    handles_a_pair_of_varying_stringish(\"foo\".to_string(), \"foo\");\n}\n\nI think in these situations, impl Trait is an effective choice for readability and flexibility. I do not encourage you to use it everywhere, for everything. Strive for readability and understandability, not \"slick\"/arcane APIs.\nA Generic Implementation\nIn order to refine this design we can pay attention to some key trait implementations:\n\nimpl&lt;T&gt; Into&lt;Option&lt;T&gt;&gt; for T\nimpl&lt;T&gt; Default for Option&lt;T&gt;\n\nThis means we can do the following:\nfn optional_arg_with_into&lt;Thing&gt;(\n    thing: impl Into&lt;Option&lt;Thing&gt;&gt;\n) -&gt; Thing\nwhere Thing: Default {\n    thing.into().unwrap_or(Thing::default())\n}\n\n#[test]\nfn verify_assemptions() {\n    optional_arg_with_into(Vec::&lt;u64&gt;::default());\n    optional_arg_with_into(vec![1_u64, 2, 3]);\n    let out: Vec&lt;u64&gt; = optional_arg_with_into(None::&lt;Vec&lt;u64&gt;&gt;); // Type hinting\n}\n\nIn this very limited demo code we need to provide quite a bit of type hinting to the None argument. This is not normally the case for more projects with a non-trivial codebase.\nAt this point, you're able to leverage a couple basic traits (Default and From) to give your users a more flexible API.\nCaveats\nAs you may have noticed in the last example, in the case of very simple code this can get pretty verbose. That's because we're not doing anything with the return/argument values. As your project grows the need for the hinting will disappear, as the compiler will be able to make more inferences about the types of things.\nUsing this technique can reduce your ability to flexibly accept things that turn into the inner argument. Eg a U where impl From&lt;U&gt; for T. You might need to jump through some hoops. Getting around this the easy way will force your users to do T::from(u) in the argument position when calling. Still, not too bad.\nBenchmarking\nLet's make sure that adding this flexibility doesn't have a huge performance impact on our code. I used Criterion and wrote a small suite for our demo code. Since the code is trivial (it basically just converts and converts back), we can explore the cost of just doing this operation. Here is the entire bench code:\n#[macro_use(criterion_main, criterion_group)] extern crate criterion;\nuse criterion::Criterion;\n\ncriterion_main!(benches);\ncriterion_group!(benches, optional_args::group);\n\nmod optional_args {\n    use criterion::Criterion;\n\n    fn value_arg&lt;Thing&gt;(thing: Thing) -&gt; Thing {\n        thing\n    }\n\n    fn optional_arg&lt;Thing&gt;(thing: Option&lt;Thing&gt;) -&gt; Thing\n    where Thing: Default {\n        thing.unwrap_or(Thing::default())\n    }\n\n    fn optional_arg_with_into&lt;Thing&gt;(\n        thing: impl Into&lt;Option&lt;Thing&gt;&gt;\n    ) -&gt; Thing\n    where Thing: Default {\n        thing.into().unwrap_or(Thing::default())\n    }\n\n    pub(crate) fn group(c: &amp;mut Criterion) {\n        c.bench_function(\"value 1_u64\", |b| b.iter(|| -&gt; u64 {\n            let value = value_arg(1_u64);\n            value + 1\n        }));\n        c.bench_function(\"optional Some(1_u64)\", |b| b.iter(|| -&gt; u64 {\n            let value = optional_arg(Some(1_u64));\n            value + 1\n        }));\n        c.bench_function(\"optional_into 1_u64\", |b| b.iter(|| -&gt; u64 {\n            let value = optional_arg_with_into(1_u64);\n            value + 1\n        }));\n        c.bench_function(\"optional_into Some(1_u64)\", |b| b.iter(|| -&gt; u64 {\n            let value: u64 = optional_arg_with_into(Some(1_u64));\n            value + 1\n        }));\n        c.bench_function(\"optional_into (u64) None\", |b| b.iter(|| -&gt; u64 {\n            let value: u64 = optional_arg_with_into(None);\n            value + 1\n        }));\n        c.bench_function(\"optional_into 1_u8.into()\", |b| b.iter(|| -&gt; u64 {\n            let value: u64 = optional_arg_with_into(u64::from(1_u8));\n            value + 1\n        }));\n        c.bench_function(\"optional_into Vec&lt;u64&gt;::new()\", |b| b.iter(|| -&gt; Vec&lt;u64&gt; {\n            let value: Vec&lt;u64&gt; = optional_arg_with_into(Vec::&lt;u64&gt;::new());\n            value\n        }));\n        c.bench_function(\"optional_into (Vec&lt;u64&gt;) None\", |b| b.iter(|| -&gt; Vec&lt;u64&gt; {\n            let value: Vec&lt;u64&gt; = optional_arg_with_into(None::&lt;Vec&lt;u64&gt;&gt;);\n            value\n        }));\n    }\n}\n\nIt's pretty snappy, enough so I'm still not entirely convinced it's not getting optimized out somehow.

During our exploration we noted that choosing to declare our functions semantically, and/or enabling a more flexible API doesn't have to cost much.\nIf you're interested in learning more about enabling flexible APIs in Rust, I'd reccomend exploring the Guidelines. I'd also reccomend exploring the Builder Pattern, since it's generally more well used in Rust.\nThanks for reading! Hope to use your lovely code soon. 😉\n\nP.S.

In a department store, shoes are a subcategory of clothing, while your favorite thermos is probably in the travel department.\nIn any Github organization, there are teams within teams within teams. In any large department store there are categories deeply nested. In any recipe book, there are many ways to classify food.\nSo how can we model them?\n\nJake (my boyfriend) and I have been exploring relational database concepts out of interest and pure geekery. This was a fun problem that I gave him and we got to work it out together. It was so fun we wanted to share! We won't beat the bush around with PostgreSQL installation, security, setup, blah blah at this time, let's just have some pure database fun for a few minutes!\nCore Problem\nHandle a high amount of reads and a small amount of writes over a small to medium amount of keys (in this case, a text field), each of which possibly has a reference to a parent key.\nIn this concrete example, we will replicate team structures. Start with the teams existing inside some small organization, each with a name and possibly a parent:\nnameparent\nEngineeringNULL\nGeschäftstätigkeitEngineering\nProductEngineering\nInternsProduct\nAdministrationNULL\nHuman ResourcesAdministration\nFinanceAdministration\nMarketingNULL\nLogisticsNULL\n国际化NULL\n\nThen somehow mixin the path which shows the datum's place in the hierarchy.\nnameparentpath\nAdministrationNULL{Administration}\nFinanceAdministration{Administration,Finance}\nHuman ResourcesAdministration{Administration,Human Resources}\nEngineeringNULL{Engineering}\nGeschäftstätigkeitEngineering{Engineering,Geschäftstätigkeit}\nProductEngineering{Engineering,Product}\nInternsProduct{Engineering,Product,Interns}\nLogisticsNULL{Logistics}\nMarketingNULL{Marketing}\n国际化NULL{国际化}\n\nFor this exercise, the exact format of the path is not important. An HTML string, a comma separated list, or any ordered collection is acceptable.\nConcepts\nWe'll actually cover two solutions, both of which demonstrate a few core concepts! \nFor the first solution, ensure you're familiar with the ideas of NULL, Primary Keys, and Foreign Keys. We'll need these for building safe, efficient linking between teams and their parents.\nWe'll then use a Materialized View to create a sort of cache of the point-in-time team structure. We'll refresh this using a Function that is Triggered whenever the original table is written to.\nFor the next solution, we'll explore the tailor-made ltree type that can solve our needs without the complex mechanics of the first solution. Further, this solution offers some useful functionality like subpaths.\nBefore we start\nPlease make sure your database is in UTF-8! We're going to be exploring international text today.

Why not try to make a motor yourself, or with your cohort?\nThe below video explains how you can build a simple motor out of some basic supplies. This project is more suitable for younger or less technically inclined humans. Note that the motors used in a Quadcopter are slightly more sophisticated.\n\n    \n    \n\nTinker or Make a Demo\nThe below video has a fantastic, in-depth explaination of how motors work and includes a number of setups which can help you understand the mechanics and motion of a motor.\nIf you have any old drills or other motored devices hanging around (or found at the thrift store) you can transform it into a number of great demos.\n\nGetting your hands on something is unquestionably the best way to learn, having demos and experiments is a fantastic way to enhance your lessons or self-study.\n\n\n    \n    \n\nMeasuring the Motor\nIn order to get some firm measurements about the motor, we built an apparatus to hold it and attached wires to it.\nSince we didn't want to damage the motor we were careful and used very small wire looped into the connector. Then we used tape to keep the copper wires seperate. The wires touching would cause a short circuit and be very bad (resulting in smoke and an angry motor.)\n\n        Taping\n        \n    \nAfter that was complete we used an adjustable soldering stand to hold the motor up in the path of a photogate sensor. The idea was to use the propellor to break the photogate's beam and use the number of breaks to determine the rotations per minute (RPM) of the propellor at various speeds.\n\n    \n    \n\nWith the motor held safely, the photogate in place, and the power supply wired in to provide power to the motor, we attached our photogate to a measurement device to start our experiment.\nFailure. It turns out that the software was unable to effectively measure the propellor at higher speeds. The quadcopters motors are rated up to 14,000 RPM and it's understandable that standard equiptment might struggle with this.\nThis threw us for a bit of a loop but we figured out a better, simpler method. We decided to utilize a strobe light to \"stop\" the motor.\n\nHow can a strobe light be used to measure RPM?\n\nFirst the strobe light pulses its light at a constant, uniform rate, and the motor is turning at a (mostly) constant, uniform rate. Because of this, if the strobe light pulses at some amount of pulses per minute ($$ PPM $$) which is equal to the motors rotations per minute ($$ RPM $$) then each pulse of light will shine on approximately the same image of the motor. This image is what we see observing it.\n$$\nPPM = RPM\n$$\nYou can see how it looks in this below video, apologies for the video quality and loud sound, strobes are noisy and cameras don't image the way our eyes do.\n\n    \n    \n\nThis is a very fun and curious experiment to try on your own or with your cohort however strobe lights can be hard to source.\nMeasurements\nUsing a pair of multimeters and an adjustable power supply we could take measurements of the motor at various power settings.\n\n        Measuring Setup\n        \n    \nFirst, let's take a look at the relationship between voltage and the rotations per minute (RPM) of the propeller. Voltage is the difference in potential between the hot and ground wires.\n\nIf you picture yourself as an electron walking along a road (the wire), you can picture voltage as how steep the hill is.\n\n\n        Voltage vs. RPM\n        \n    \nThe relationship that current and the rotations per minute have is also very much a straight line.\n\nIf you picture yourself as an electron current is how hard you're pushing against something.\n\n\n        Current vs. RPM\n        \n    \nThe power of the motor is equals to the voltage times the current. You can see that this relationship is a nice, smooth curve. It's interesting to note that there are diminishing returns the more power you put in.\n$$\nvoltage * current = power\n$$\n\n        Power vs. RPM\n        \n    \nThe angular velocity is the speed at which the blade of the propeller is rotating around the motor's axis. This relationship is straight, just like the voltage vs RPM graph.\n$$\nvelocity_{angular} = RPM * \\frac{2\\pi}{60 seconds}\n$$\n\n        Voltage vs. Angular Velocity\n        \n    \nMotors in Action\nIn the following graphs we captured data from the quadcopter using the Crazyflie client's logging functionalities. A motor value of 0 indicates that no power was sent to the motor, while a higher number means more power was sent. (We asked the Bitcraze folks what these values represented here.)\nIn order to capture this data we held the quadcopter (mostly) in place and fully triggered given inputs. The wobble you see in the motor plots is due to variances in the outputs of the stablization algorithms as they react on sensor input.\nPitch\n\n        Pitch Increase\n        \n    \nIn these you can see the very clear demonstration of the front motor and rear motors raising or lowering depending on the input.\n\n        Pitch Decrease\n        \n    \nRoll\n\n        Roll Increase\n        \n    \nIn these you can observe the left and right motors changing accordingly.\n\n        Roll Decrease\n        \n    \nYaw\n\n        Yaw Increase\n        \n    \nFinally, in these you can see the diagonal motors changing as we've previously discussed.\n\n        Yaw Decrease\n        \n    \n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-motors/","title":"Quadcopters: Motors"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-orientation/":{"body":"\nSpinnning tens of thousands times a second, four rotors cut through the air with their propellors. Their motion lifts them in unison, for they are connected together. In the center of the apparatus sits a bank of sensors, processors, and a radio acting in concert to control the great flow of air passing over it.\n\n\nSome ways away, perhaps near, perhaps far, its pilot watches over it. Whether by program or controller, they hold the fate of the airborne being in their hands.\n\nQuadcopters are fascinating marriages of physics, electronics, aviation, and computer science that have only become popular in the last couple of years. Examining them allows us to explore a number of interesting topics.\nBut first, a bit of an introduction...\n\nWhat is This?\nThis post is the first in a series of articles surrounding quadcopters, how they work, why they work, and what makes them tick. While these articles will aim to be approachable for all humans they will be targetted mainly towards outreach educators, young scientists, and curious tinkerers.\n\nLook for emphasized notes like this! They will be questions, key takeaways, and other important notes.\n\nAs we progress, readers will learn about aeronautics, physics, mathematics, electonics, and computer science. If at any point you become confused or have questions please feel encouraged to ask via email.\nWho We Are\nI, Ana Hobden, am a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Victoria. I am interested in systems, infrastructure, networking, and embedded devices. Currently, I'm a new member of the (Mod)ularity Squad with advisor Yvonne Coady.\nMy partner, Bob Sedlock, is a Physics instructor at Camosun College. He's interested in relativity, fluid dynamics, and physics in general.\nOur work is supported in part by NSERC, Camosun College, and the University of Victoria.\nChoice for Experiment\nSince our main goal is to explore the workings of the quadcopter, we sought a device that fit several desirable qualities:\n\nMeasurable: Instrumentation for logging data is vital to producing any sort of interesting information.\nModifiable: Also known as 'Hackable' in this context, it's useful to be able to change the behaivor of that which is being experimented upon.\nRepairable: One of the biggest concerns with quadcopters is the ease of replacing their oft-damaged parts.\nCompatible: In order to make sure others can replicate our experiments, we want to\nCommunity Friendly: We are extremely strong supporters of the Maker movement and open source, being able to contribute back is a huge boon.\n\nWe also had to consider budget. After surveying the field and considering our target audience, we decided to set our budget at under $400 CAD. It was important to find a quality device that was still accessible to others.\nWe ended up choosing the BitCraze Crazyflie 2.0 because it satisfied our requirements. The developers of the device are three awesome folks from Sweden!\n\n        Unpacking\n        \n    \n\n        Crazyflie\n        \n    \n\n        Crazyflie again\n        \n    \nIn diagrams we will often simplify the quad into the following diagram:\n\nThe front is identified by the knob with an arrow. If the arrows around the motors appear black, it means they are holding steady, if they are green they are speeding up, and if they are red they are slowing down.\nHow Does It Work?\nA quadcopter lifts itself into the air with four electric motors. In the Crazyflie's case, small coreless motors are used. These four motors are the actuators of the quadcopter and, under normal circumstances, are the only things that actually move on the device.\nAttached to the four motors are propellers. Since the motors of the quadcopter spin propellers which push air downward. Because of this pushing of air downward there is an equal and opposite amount of force pushing the quadcopter upward. This characteristic is the third of Sir Isaac Newton's laws. Every action must have an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nHow can we use the four motors to keep the Quadcopter hovering in place?\n\nAs you may have learnt from physics, the total force acting on a body is equal to it's mass times its acceleration. To talk about forces, we'll use the idea of a Newton (N), you can think about a newton as about the weight of an apple you hold in your hand. It would exert about 1 N of force downward on your hand. In order to hold the apple stationary you must exert the same amount of force (1 N) upwards.\nNow, our Quadcopter is about 28 grams in mass. Gravity is pulling down on the quad with 0.28 Newtons. This means that our quad must offset this force to hover in place.\nTherefore four motors each must contribute an equal \\( \\frac{1}{4} 0.28 N \\) to stay level in the air. If one motor contributes slightly more or less than it's equal share, that side of the quad would lift or fall accordingly.\n\\[ (Mass * Accceleration)_{Quadcopter} = Force_{Gravity} + Force_{Motor 1} + Force_{Motor 2} + ... \\]\nGetting Oriented\nWhen reasoning about the location and orientation of a quadcopter we need to consider three values.\n\nPitch is the up-down tilt. Having a positive pitch means the quad is tilted skywards, while a negative pitch means that the ground is approaching.\nYaw is the rotation of the quad. Changing the yaw is equivalent to you turning left or right. A negative value turns the quad counter clockwise, a positive value turns it clockwise.\nRoll is the rotational tilt about an axis running from the quad's central front to back. This is the equivalent of tilting to the side such that you are standing on one foot. A positive roll tilts the quad to the right, while a negative roll tilts it to the left.\n\n\nPitching, Yawing, and Rolling\nIn order to cause a change in Pitch or Roll we can cause motors on one side of the quad to contribute a bit more, and the motors on the other side to contribute a bit less.\n\n\n\nHow can we change yaw?\n\nYaw doesn't necessarily require the quad to tilt in a particular manner, instead, it requires it to rotate in place. A first guess that the quad might tilt slightly in order to somehow turn is quite valid, however the answer is more subtle than that!\nIn order to change it's yaw the quad utilizes the following strategy:\n\nSo how does this work? Well, the quadcopter must somehow exert a sideways force in order to turn.\nThink about standing with one foot on a still merry-go-round, if you wish to cause it to spin you must push on the ground with your other foot one way, the ground then pushes you (and the merry-go-round) the other way.\nBut if the quadcopter can only push air downward with its motors, how does it rotate in place?\nEqual and Opposite\nNot all of the propellers are the same. Have a look at these two:\n\n        Propellers\n        \n    \nDo you see how one is \"flipped\" compared to the other? That's because if we had all four propellers the same the quad would simply not function correctly. Let's take a look!\nWith propellers paired up correctly:\n\n    \n    \n\nWith all propellers the same:\n\n    \n    \n\nYou can see how when all of the propellers are the same the quad is unable to take off and it tends to spin a bit. When the motors on the diagonal have matching propellers the quad performs as desired. Why? Notice the directions of the arrows of the motors:\n\nSee how the motors on any side counteract one another? That is, the go in the opposite direction. This is again because of Sir Newton's law, and indeed the mechanics of how yaw works.\nDuring our later motors article we'll discuss this effect in detail and examine it's implications more deeply.\nLooking Forward\nOver the next few weeks we'll be posting articles on the following topics related to Quadcopters:\n\nMotors\nSensors\nStabilization\nRadio\n\nWe'll be introducting hands-on demos which you can replicate yourself (or with your class!) as well as Arduino tutorials for those interested in learning to work with these devices.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-orientation/","title":"Quadcopters: Orientation"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-sensors/":{"body":"Most intelligent devices existing in the physical world, a quadcopter included, take input from sensors and act on them in some way, possibly producing an output.\n\n        Digital Sensors\n        \n    \nSome sensors are digital, like a button or switch, and can be read via a digitalRead() on an Arduino, returning either HIGH or LOW.\n\n        Analog Sensors\n        \n    \nOther sensors are analog and can return anything in the range of 0-1023. These are things like potentiometers, force sensors, light sensors, and temperature sensors.\n\n        I2C Sensors\n        \n    \nFinally, some sensors use Inter-integrated Circuit (I2C) or Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) to interface. Typically these are found on more complicated chips like gyroscopes and accelerometers. These interfaces require multiple wires and often require you to build a small wrapper around the interface to interact with it. If you enjoy playing with Arduinos, companies like Adafruit almost always include libraries for their products.\nSensors on a Quadcopter\nDespite their size, quadcopters are a outfitted with an array of sensors. If you check the board you'll see that there are only two sensor chips on the board, the MPU-925 and the LPS25H which handles pressure. The MPU-925 hosts a three-axis magnetometer, accelerometer, and gyroscope, together these offer 9 Degrees of Freedom (DOF). Combined with the pressure sensor this gives us 10DOF.\n\nIt can be a bit pricey to source integrated circuits like gyroscopes. Because of the cost we did not build Arduino labs for this part of our series, but if you'd like we'd be happy to, we just need to know!\n\nAs a note, on some of the graphs below you might notice a fair amount of noise. Some of this is inherant to the sensor, other times it is because of how we're demonstrating things. We'll talk about how to negate this at the end!\nMagnetometer\nMagnetometers measure the magnetic field around them, allowing the device to answer questions like which way is north? They are, essentially, a compass. The quadcopter uses this to help determine it's orientation in space.\nThe following video explains how one type of magnetometer, called a Fluxgate Magnometer, functions.\n\n    \n    \n\nIf you have one to play with you can explore it's readings by taking a reasonably strong magnet and moving it around the sensor. Notice how when we flip over the magnet we get a negative reading?\n\n    \n    \n\n\n        Magnetometer Readings\n        \n    \nSome uses of Magnetometers:\n\nAurora Detection - Magnetometers can give an indication of an aurora happening before light is visible.\nMining - These sensors can be used to detect the composition of ground.\nSmartphones - Magnetometers play a part in how your phone tells you were you are in the world.\nRemote Sensing - There are various surveying and imagine applications including something called Magnetovision. (Cool, right?)\n\nGyroscope\nGyroscopes measure the rotational acceleration of the sensor. They are commonly used in planes to determine the horizon.\n\nThe gyroscope and accelerometer in a quadcopter are called a Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). There are other, non-MEMS gyroscopes that are used widely as well that have some interesting behaivors.\n\nA quick, basic video of how these work is below:\n\n    \n    \n\nHere's how we can demonstrate this sensor, along with the output:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n        Gyroscope Readings\n        \n    \nAccelerometer\nAccelerometers measure the lateral acceleration of the sensor (not rotationally). They're how your smartphone knows when it's turned around.\nThere is a guide to Piezoelectric Accelerometers here that we sound useful. The Engineer Guy also has this great video (along with many more!)\n\n    \n    \n\nHere's how we can demonstrate this sensor, along with the output:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n        Accelerometer Readings\n        \n    \nSome uses of Accelerometers:\n\nActivity Monitors - Like step counters and skipping counters!\nVechicle Safety - Accelerometers can detect sudden stops, like vechicle crashes.\nEarthquake Detection - Earthquakes create lots of shifting which an accelerometer can detect and measure.\nVolcanology - Modern accelerometers can be used to detect the flows of magma.\nComputer Inputs - Some new user interface solutions utilize acceleromters to capture input.\n\n\nWhy not velocity? Fun fact: It's impossible to determine if you experiencing a velocity in any direction without a frame of reference. It's much easier to collect acceleration and use mathematics (like something called integration) to determine velocity at a given time. How do we do this?\n\nImagine that our accelerometer takes measurements every 1 second, and we have 4 readings [1, 2, -2, -1] in centimeters starting from rest. What is the quadcopter doing at the end? How far did it travel? (We'll use basic math here! If you know calculus this is a perfect chance to explain the basics to your cohort.)\n\nThe first second, we have an acceleration of \\(1\\frac{cm}{s^2}\\). We therefore have a velocity of \\(1\\frac{cm}{s}\\). We've travelled 1 cm.\nThe second second, we have an acceleration of \\(2\\frac{cm}{s^2}\\). We therefore have a velocity of \\(3\\frac{cm}{s}\\). We've travelled 3 cm.\nThe third second, we have an acceleration of \\(-2\\frac{cm}{s^2}\\). We therefore have a velocity of \\(1\\frac{cm}{s}\\). We've travelled 4 cm.\nThe fourth second, we have an acceleration of \\(-1\\frac{cm}{s^2}\\). We therefore have a velocity of \\(0\\frac{cm}{s}\\). We've travelled 4 cm.\n\nYou can apply the same analysis to gyroscopes.\nPressure Sensor\nPressure Sensors measure the air pressure around the device. The utility of this on a quadcopter may not be obvious at first.\n\nPlease, consider the following: The higher you travel in the air, the lower the air pressure becomes.\n\nTherefore if the quadcopter has a reference to the air pressure of where it took off from it is able to understand roughly how high it is relative to that point.\n\n    \n    \n\nThese readings are a bit noisy, sorry.\n\n        Pressure Readings\n        \n    \nSensor Fusion\nOne interesting technique to improve the sensor readings is to do something called sensor fusion which combines data from disparate sources to help refine measurements. Sensor fusion is a huge benefit to compact or low power systems which often suffer from higher inaccuracies.\nOne example of sensor fusion which you may have experienced before is stereoscopic vision, when we can use two slightly offset 2D cameras to produce a 3D-looking image.\nIn our quadcopter the gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer are fused together to improve reduce uncertainty. What exactly does this mean?\nWhen we're measuring a sensor and trying to extract data from it sometimes the input we recieve has variance, like our Barometer readings above. If we combine this data, say with our accelerometer's Z (up-down) axis, we can have a more refined picture of the quadcopter's position, velocity, and acceleration in space instead of just relying on the barometer.\nThese calculations usually work somewhat similar to this:\n\\[Result = \\frac{(Variance_{Baro}^{-2}*Reading_{Baro}) +\n(Variance_{Accel Z}^{-2}*Reading_{Accel Z})}{(Variance_{Baro}^{-2} + Variance_{Accel Z}^{-2})}\\]\nThis is called a linear combination of the two measurements, weighted by their variances.\n\nSpecial thanks to my helper, Laura, for assisting me with capturing stable videography.\n\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-sensors/","title":"Quadcopters: Sensors"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-stabilization/":{"body":"In our past articles we've explored some of the basics of the mechanics of Quadcopters. In this article we'll be doing something a bit different and discussing the algorithms behind how the Quadcopter keeps itself stable.\nTo do this we'll actually be inspecting some of the official Bitcraze Firmware and it's stabilizer.c implementation.\n\nIt's okay if you don't know C or understand what's going on in this file, that's part of the purpose of this article!\n\n\nThe Crazyflie uses a real time operating system called FreeRTOS which is a well regarded industry standard.\nStructure\nC code and Arduino code are fairly similar, and the best practice is to lay out your code roughly as follows:\n// Includes\n// Definitions\n// Variables\n// Functions\n\nSo what are all these? Let's break them down.\nIncludes\nIn order to use code from other files it's necessary to bring them \"in scope\". Includes come in two forms:\n#include &lt;math.h&gt;     // Use a system provided library.\n#include \"FreeRTOS.h\" // Use from the project library.\n\nNotice how we include .h files instead of .c files? These are called header files and contain functions, variables, and definitions. In most cases, each .h file has a respective .c file.\n\nThe distinction between .c and .h files is largely a historical one. Some modern languages have combined the two.\n\nDefinitions\nDefinitions are a way to assign certain values to specific names. #defines can be values or expressions.\n#define example 1\n#define max(a,b) ((a) &gt; (b) ? (a) : (b))\n#define min(a,b) ((a) &lt; (b) ? (a) : (b))\n\nNote: Definitions cannot change while the program is running, this is not a place for variables.\nConsider them like \"macros\", if we enter max(1,2) then our compiler will replace it with ((1) &gt; (2) ? (1) : (2)).\nVariables\nWe've used variables in our Arduino experiments already. Variables are the main workhorse of data storage.\nint foo;\nstatic int bar = 2;\nconst int baz = 3;\nfoo = 1;\n\nVariables follow the format type name = value. You can also do just type name and name will be null (nothing) until it is set.\nSometimes you'll also see things like static and const in front. static variables exist over the lifetime of the program and are unique inside that given code file, they are not accessible outside of it. const variables cannot change their value after declared.\nNot all variables will be simple values, for example, below we declare three Axis3f. When designing programs it's quite easy to create your own types to store whatever you might need.\nstatic Axis3f gyro; // Gyro axis data in deg/s\nstatic Axis3f acc;  // Accelerometer axis data in mG\nstatic Axis3f mag;  // Magnetometer axis data in testla\n\nYou'll see float occur commonly in the stabilization code, this is a decimal value like 0.00001.\nFunctions\nFunctions are step-by-step procedures which (generally) have an input and an output. The simplest function is this:\nvoid foo() {}\n\nThis is a function with no input or output! void is the return type, void in most cases means nothing is returned. A function which takes a pair of integers and returns their sum looks like this:\nint sum(int a, int b) {\n\treturn a+b;\n}\n\nFunctions can be invoked by calling them like so:\nint should_be_three = sum(1, 2);\nUnderstanding the Code\nThe stabilization code is broken up into a few sections. We'll take the code directly from the project and go over it slowly. If anything doesn't make sense please email me and I'll make it more clear!\nInitialization\nvoid stabilizerInit(void)\n{\n  if(isInit)\n    return;\n\n  motorsInit();\n  imu6Init();\n  sensfusion6Init();\n  controllerInit();\n\n  rollRateDesired = 0;\n  pitchRateDesired = 0;\n  yawRateDesired = 0;\n\n  xTaskCreate(stabilizerTask, (const signed char * const)STABILIZER_TASK_NAME,\n              STABILIZER_TASK_STACKSIZE, NULL, STABILIZER_TASK_PRI, NULL);\n\n  isInit = true;\n}\n\nThe stabilizerInit() function is what starts up the stabilization routines. You can see in the first line that if it is already been initialized the function simply returns early, doing nothing. (Note how isInit is set at the end of a normal call)\nThe code then initializes it's dependencies (which also exit early if already initialized!) After, it sets the desired orientation values to zero.\nFinally, the function calls xTaskCreate which spawns a task which can run concurrently alongside other tasks. This particular task runs the stabilizerTask() function.\n\nIn general, you can consider the entire quadcopter somewhat like your computer. It runs multiple tasks all the time. On your computer, this is things like your web browser and music player. On the quadcopter it's things like the stabilizer and radio.\n\nThe Task\nOkay, so what does this task look like then? Let's take a look! This function is longer, so I'll be breaking it up.\nstatic void stabilizerTask(void* param)\n{\n  uint32_t attitudeCounter = 0;\n  uint32_t altHoldCounter = 0;\n  uint32_t lastWakeTime;\n\n  vTaskSetApplicationTaskTag(0, (void*)TASK_STABILIZER_ID_NBR);\n\n  //Wait for the system to be fully started to start stabilization loop\n  systemWaitStart();\n\n  lastWakeTime = xTaskGetTickCount();\n\n  while(1)\n  {\n    vTaskDelayUntil(&amp;lastWakeTime, F2T(IMU_UPDATE_FREQ)); // 500Hz\n\nIn the first few lines the function allocates some space for some 32-bit unsigned integers, these only represent absolute numbers. You can see that lastWakeTime is set later in the code. There are a few functions whose purpose is not immediately clear, let's go over them.\n\nvTaskSetApplicationTaskTag() - Sets the 'tag' of the tag for debugging purposes. We need not concern ourselves with this.\nxTaskGetTickCount() - This returns the number of ticks since the task was started (we saw this above).\nvTaskDelayUntil() - This call asks the FreeRTOS to delay any execution of the task until the appropriate time, then start it again.\n\nYou'll notice as well that there is the start of a while(1) loop, which is an infinite loop, and will keep going until it is manually exited. Let's move forward.\n// Magnetometer not yet used more then for logging.\nimu9Read(&amp;gyro, &amp;acc, &amp;mag);\n\nif (imu6IsCalibrated())\n{\n  commanderGetRPY(&amp;eulerRollDesired, &amp;eulerPitchDesired, &amp;eulerYawDesired);\n  commanderGetRPYType(&amp;rollType, &amp;pitchType, &amp;yawType);\n\n  // 250HZ\n  if (++attitudeCounter &gt;= ATTITUDE_UPDATE_RATE_DIVIDER)\n  {\n    sensfusion6UpdateQ(gyro.x, gyro.y, gyro.z, acc.x, acc.y, acc.z, FUSION_UPDATE_DT);\n    sensfusion6GetEulerRPY(&amp;eulerRollActual, &amp;eulerPitchActual, &amp;eulerYawActual);\n\n    accWZ = sensfusion6GetAccZWithoutGravity(acc.x, acc.y, acc.z);\n    accMAG = (acc.x*acc.x) + (acc.y*acc.y) + (acc.z*acc.z);\n    // Estimate speed from acc (drifts)\n    vSpeed += deadband(accWZ, vAccDeadband) * FUSION_UPDATE_DT;\n\n    controllerCorrectAttitudePID(eulerRollActual, eulerPitchActual, eulerYawActual,\n                                 eulerRollDesired, eulerPitchDesired, -eulerYawDesired,\n                                 &amp;rollRateDesired, &amp;pitchRateDesired, &amp;yawRateDesired);\n    attitudeCounter = 0;\n  }\n\nAt the top of this chunk you'll see imu9Read(&amp;gyro, &amp;acc, &amp;mag); which, if you've never used pointers, may seem odd. Essentially what we're doing is calling the imu9Read function and passing it the three pointers to the location of our variables. The function can then dereference these pointers and write into them. This is a common practice when you want to modify a complex value in a function without needing to copy the entire thing.\nThe commanderGetRPY() and commanderGetRPYType() fetch the desired inputs from the user, like an increase in pitch or roll.\nAfter, if a counter is high enough (the ++ increments it) we do an 'attitude' update. This is not to be confused with altitude. The term attitude is something that seems to be internal to the Crazyflie, and appears to just be their term for a need for adjustment.\nThe sensfusion6UpdateQ() and sensfusion6GetEulerRPY() functions pull the current quadcopter orientation from the sensors onboard. You may note that this only updates the Gyro and Accelerometer, that's because the Crazyflie does not use the Magnometer in this code yet.\nAccWZ is used along with the deadband (a way to reduce the amount of data collected and save battery life) to estimate the vertical speed of the device. It appears that AccMAG is unused.\nThen controllerCorrectAttitudePID() is called. This takes the desired values and through a round-about method works with PidObjects to update the pointers we pass in (The &amp; values). PidObjects are used to model mathematics that drive the quadcopter.\n  // 100HZ\n  if (imuHasBarometer() &amp;&amp; (++altHoldCounter &gt;= ALTHOLD_UPDATE_RATE_DIVIDER))\n  {\n    stabilizerAltHoldUpdate();\n    altHoldCounter = 0;\n  }\n\n  if (rollType == RATE)\n  {\n    rollRateDesired = eulerRollDesired;\n  }\n  if (pitchType == RATE)\n  {\n    pitchRateDesired = eulerPitchDesired;\n  }\n  if (yawType == RATE)\n  {\n    yawRateDesired = -eulerYawDesired;\n  }\n\nNext, if necessary, an altitude hold update is performed. Afterwards the three axes of movement are updated to their desired values.\n  // TODO: Investigate possibility to subtract gyro drift.\n  controllerCorrectRatePID(gyro.x, -gyro.y, gyro.z,\n                           rollRateDesired, pitchRateDesired, yawRateDesired);\n\n  controllerGetActuatorOutput(&amp;actuatorRoll, &amp;actuatorPitch, &amp;actuatorYaw);\n\n  if (!altHold || !imuHasBarometer())\n  {\n    // Use thrust from controller if not in altitude hold mode\n    commanderGetThrust(&amp;actuatorThrust);\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    // Added so thrust can be set to 0 while in altitude hold mode after disconnect\n    commanderWatchdog();\n  }\n\nHere the task updates the desired rate, and updates its picture of how fast the quadcopter is actuating with its motors. Then it is updating the thrust based on input from the user or the altitude hold control.\n      if (actuatorThrust &gt; 0)\n      {\n#if defined(TUNE_ROLL)\n        distributePower(actuatorThrust, actuatorRoll, 0, 0);\n#elif defined(TUNE_PITCH)\n        distributePower(actuatorThrust, 0, actuatorPitch, 0);\n#elif defined(TUNE_YAW)\n        distributePower(actuatorThrust, 0, 0, -actuatorYaw);\n#else\n        distributePower(actuatorThrust, actuatorRoll, actuatorPitch, -actuatorYaw);\n#endif\n      }\n      else\n      {\n        distributePower(0, 0, 0, 0);\n        controllerResetAllPID();\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\nFinally, the task distributes power to the actuators. The #if defined(TUNE_ROLL) lines are compile time options meant for debugging, normally the #else case is used.\nWhat does it all mean?\nIn order to stabilize itself a quadcopter must rapidly, constantly sample its sensors, controller, and actuators in order to get the best picture of two very important things:\n\nWhat it is doing at that moment.\nWhat it should be doing at that moment.\n\nIn order to determine these values it uses mathematical models to get an idea of it's orientation and status. If you read our article on sensors you may recall how we transformed our accelerometer data into velocity data, this is the same idea. Then, the quadcopter attempts to find a happy, stable place that satisfies these requirements.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-stabilization/","title":"Quadcopters: Stabilization"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-yaw/":{"body":"So, in our earlier article we talked about Yaw a little but, but we didn't get into details. First, let's take a look at what yaw looks like under simple circumstances, then we'll explain the motion.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nNotice how two propellers come to a stop when yawing?\n\nUnderstanding Torque\nLet's first talk about Center of Gravity, have you ever tried to balance an object on the tip of your finger? That's a center of gravity! Fun Fact: Your center of gravity is your belly button! The quads is, predictably, near its center.\n\n        Center of Gravity for a Quad\n        \n    \nTorque ($$ \\tau $$) is a twisting force, you use it when you do things like turn a door-knob handle, use a wrench, or pedal a bicycle. Now, the torque produced by a force equals the magnitude of the force ($$ F $$) times the radius ($$ r $$), or distance from the center of gravity.\n$$ \\tau = F*r $$\n\nBack to Yaw\nSo what does torque have to do with the yaw of the quadcopter? Well, it turns out, a heck of a lot! Remember how the motors on our quadcopter spin?\n\nNote again how motors on the diagonal travel in the same direction while motors on the same \"side\" travel in opposite directions.\nNow, consider the torque generated by the motors.\n\nIn the diagram, blue arrows represent the force of the motor pushing on the air, while red arrows represent the force of the air pushing back on the motors.\n\nEvery action force has an equal and opposite reaction force. - Sir Isaac Newton\n\nNote that the force is drawn at the centre of the propeller. In this example we're using the average distance and force to simplify calculations. Feel encouraged to follow along and use calculus concepts (representing the force as a continuous amount), the math still works out!\nIn our example we're only showing one motor, but recalling that two motors almost shut off while yawing, and the other motor is generating the same directional forces, it is safe to do this.\nCalculating the net maximum torque in this diagram can be done using the following equation:\n$$\n\\tau = F(r_1)-F(r_2) = F(r_1-r_2)\n$$\nWhere $$ r_1 $$ is the bottom (larger) radius, and $$ r_2 $$ is the top (smaller) radius. The key takeaway here is for each propeller despite the forces being equal, the radii are not and because of that, $$ \\tau $$ is a positive value.\nWhat we end up with is a small amount of torque being created by each of the two active motors, these two amounts are in the same direction, and can be added together!\n\nThe combination of these two torques is sufficient to cause the quadcopter to yaw (twist) in the air.\n\nLet's Experiment!\nIn order to properly test our hypothesis, we rigged up an apparatus to demonstrate this yawing. Since the quadcopter propellers move too fast to be able to observe without specialized equipment we looked towards water.\nThis apparatus is designed to dip it's two wooden paddles into the water, with the rest of the device sitting at the surface of the water. The two paddles rotate the same as the two propellers we talked about above.\n\n        Apparatus\n        \n    \nWe were very impressed with the result. Note the yawing motion as we predicted. The apparatus did not hold up particularly well however, as you can observe, our eslastics were not particularly happy campers! This is because of the friction of them rubbing on one another.\n\n    \n    \n\nObserving under Constraints\nIn order to capture this in the air we tied our quadcopter up via string, then harnessed a weight on the bottom of it to help smooth out it's flight height. Doing this we found using elastics particularly useful as a harness point.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nBut why didn't I see the two propellers stop?\n\nGood question! Because the Quadcopter was still trying to hover in the air and could not entirely shut them off. Although you can't see it, they are actually rotating quite a bit slower.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-yaw/","title":"Quadcopters: Yaw"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-examples/":{"body":"We've also got couple nice working examples!

I'll be posting a few bits over the next weeks to help people both learn Rust, and learn about Raft!\nAs a result of Raft development two new crates have been put together for general consumption! Both of these are macro-centric and lead mainly by James.\nA Useful Error Pattern\nWorking with Raft we discovered a useful error pattern for making use of things like try!(). Let's quickly recap on why error handling can be a pain sometimes.\nLet's say you're off happily using .read() on some file descriptor (maybe a TcpStream) and than performing some action which may also result in an error. So you write a function like so:\nuse std::io::Read;\nfn read_and_action&lt;R: Read&gt;(reader: R) -&gt; Result&lt;String, _&gt; {\n\tlet buf = Vec::with_capacity(10);\n    try!(reader.read(&amp;mut buf));\n    try!(String::from_utf8(buf))\n}\n\nBut wait! There is a problem here! The first try!() and the second try!() have different errors that they might return. This won't work. Even worse, in a sufficiently complex library or application there can be many Error types in play!\nWe identified this very early in Raft and came up with a eloquent solution: Create an Error composed of the various possible errors! James went ahead and actually made a fantastic macro that you can use to do the same easily!\n/// A simple convienence type.\npub type Result&lt;T&gt; = std::result::Result&lt;T, Error&gt;;\n\n// From crate: https://github.com/james-darkfox/rs-wrapped_enum-macro\nwrapped_enum!{\n    #[derive(Debug)]\n    pub enum Error {\n    \t// Cap'n Proto Errors\n        CapnProto(capnp::Error),\n        // Cap'n Proto schema errors\n        SchemaError(capnp::NotInSchema),\n        // std::io errors\n        Io(io::Error),\n        // Our very own!\n        Raft(RaftError),\n    }\n}\n\nimpl fmt::Display for Error {\n    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter) -&gt; fmt::Result {\n        match *self {\n            Error::CapnProto(ref error) =&gt; fmt::Display::fmt(error, f),\n            Error::SchemaError(ref error) =&gt; fmt::Display::fmt(error, f),\n            Error::Io(ref error) =&gt; fmt::Display::fmt(error, f),\n            Error::Raft(ref error) =&gt; fmt::Debug::fmt(error, f),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWith this machinery in place our previous example starts to work, fantastic! This has saved us so much headache and complication in our code. Want it? Click one of the badges below!\n\n\nScoped Logging\nOkay, let's take a minute to remember how frigging awesome the log crate is. If you've got a project, large or small, this crate is super handy for helping trace, debug, and log whatever you need and to do it only when needed! The best part about the log crate is that when logs are off it's a simple noop.\nOne problem we identified, however, was that sometimes it was very difficult to identify the source of a log message. Asking \"Did it come from foo or bar?\" is only fun so many times.\nJames and Dan put together the scoped_log crate to help with this. Check out the documentation there for a usage example.\nWhen we use this crate with tests (which makes it all that much more awesome!) we use the following macro.\n/// Prepares the environment testing. Should be called as the first line of every test with the\n/// name of the test as the only argument.\n#[cfg(test)]\nmacro_rules! setup_test {\n    ($test_name:expr) =&gt; (\n        let _ = env_logger::init();\n        push_log_scope!($test_name);\n    );\n}\n\nNow our logs look like this:\nINFO:raft::replica: test_apply_client_message: ElectionTimeout\nINFO:raft::replica: test_election_3: ElectionTimeout\nINFO:raft::replica: test_election_2: ElectionTimeout\nINFO:raft::replica: test_apply_client_message: transitioning to Leader\nINFO:raft::replica: test_election_5: ElectionTimeout\nINFO:raft::replica: test_election_5: transitioning to Candidate\nDEBUG:raft::replica: test_election_5: Replica { id: 3, state: Follower, term: 0, index: 0 }: RequestVoteRequest from Replica { id: 0, term: 1, latest_log_term: 0, latest_log_index: 0 }\n\nMuch more context that we barely have to tool. Fantastic! This crate even maintains the same noop characteristic of the log crate which it heavily relies on. Want it?\n\n\nTravis &amp; Cargo!\nIf you've read any of my other articles you probably know I love tooling and automation. After my Rust, Travis, and Github Pages article Huon created the fantastic travis-cargo tool! It's incredible!\nWith its help we've moved to a sudo-less build and overall things work much better. I'll talk more about out tooling and infrastructure in a later post!\nAside: Contributors!!!\nWe now have 3 whole code contributors to Raft!

I'm very quickly able to make a change, build it, fix the errors the compiler catches for me, and build again, then test. So far the only times my tests have failed after a successful build was when I was accidently disgarding one of my channels.\nClient Interface\nCurrently, the design of my implementation is meant to be as simple as I can possibly make it. Once a RaftNode is created (RaftNode::new()) and spun up (node.spinup()) the client program will recieve a channel which to communicate on with the node.\nI wanted to remove the complexity of having to make network requests outside of the Node. If you're participating in a Raft cluster you don't want to have to think about it, you just want to read logs and append logs. Raft's goal is to implement a replicated log, or state machine.\nfn spinup(self) -&gt; (Sender&lt;ClientRequest&lt;T&gt;&gt;,\n\t\t\t\t\tReceiver&lt;ClientResponse&lt;T&gt;&gt;)\nenum ClientRequest&lt;T&gt; {\n    IndexRange {\n        start_index: u64,\n        end_index: u64,\n    },\n    AppendEntries {\n        prev_log_index: u64,\n        prev_log_term: T,\n        entries: Vec&lt;T&gt;,\n    },\n}\n\nenum ClientResponse&lt;T&gt; {\n    Accepted {\n        entries: Vec&lt;T&gt;,\n        last_index: u64,\n    },\n    Rejected {\n        reason: String,\n    },\n}\n\nRight now most of the data types I'm using are compound data enums, allowing for strongly typed, encapsulated data that is easy to work with via match statements.\nI am not sure if this is the right way to go about things, and I think that there can be some improvement, but this method of requests across a channel are, as far as I can tell, the idomatic way to communicate with a thread in Rust.\nOne cool thing about this approach is the log entries themselves can be basically anything the programmer desires as long as it can be serialized and deserialized. I'm mostly using Strings for testing.\nRemote Procedure Calls\nInside of the RaftNode's thread it binds on a UDP socket and listens for RemoteProcedureCall data. These requests are encoded and decoded through the rustc-serialize crato, but in the future serde will probably replace it.\nA RemoteProcedureCall looks almost identical to those dictated in the Raft paper:\n#[derive(RustcEncodable, RustcDecodable, Debug, Clone)]\npub enum RemoteProcedureCall&lt;T&gt; {\n    AppendEntries {\n        term: u64,\n        leader_id: u64,\n        prev_log_index: u64,\n        prev_log_term: T,\n        entries: Vec&lt;T&gt;,\n        leader_commit: u64,\n    },\n    RequestVote {\n        term: u64,\n        candidate_id: u64,\n        last_log_index: u64,\n        last_log_term: u64,\n    },\n}\n\n#[derive(RustcEncodable, RustcDecodable, Debug, Copy)]\npub enum RemoteProcedureResponse {\n    VoteAccepted { term: u64 },\n    VoteRejected { term: u64, current_leader: u64 },\n    EntriesAccepted { term: u64 },\n    EntriesRejected { term: u64 },\n}\n\nI'm not sure if the way I'm approaching the RemoteProcedureResponse is necessarily the right way to go about things. I think it might be better to model it after ClientResponse.\nProgress\nMost of the work done so far is on scaffolding, and determining interfaces. I have two nodes running locally successfully passing ClientRequests into one node, them communicating with a RemoteProcedureCall and a ClientResponse being emitted at the other node.\nI've been spending a lot of time documenting my thoughts and ideas in the code as I write it, // TODO: is sprinkled throughout.\nRepository\nCurrently the state of the code is such that I don't feel right releasing it to the public, once I have some bearance of functionality in the crate I'll be releasing it under the MIT license.\nIf you're interested in helping out with this implementation please let me know.

If you don't know what Rust is, please feel encouraged to follow along at the intro.\nBack in february I had a first prototype working. It was a partial implementation and some subtle logic flaws have been found in the reworking of the code.\n\nYou can play with the very first prototype here updated for a recent nightly.\n\nWhere We're Heading\nWith the help of Dan Burkert several dramatic architecture changes have occured.\nSummarily, the second prototype builds from the first in the following ways:\n\nThe mio Asynchronous Event Loop backs the library, providing\nit with event driven sockets and timers. This removes the loop {} and\nreduces demands on the system by using things like epoll.\nCommunication is over TCP, as opposed to UDP in the first prototype. It\nwas determined that the additional costs of TCP were worth its benefits\nprovided connections to other nodes could be maintained for multiple\ncommunications. This improves reliability of communication, ease of\nunderstanding, and opens the door for encrypted communication at a later date.\nFor more efficient communication, Cap'n Proto is used to facilitate\ncommunication between nodes. This dramatically reduces the amount of data\nwhich needs to be sent compared to the first prototype, which uses JSON.\nThe Replicated Log is abstracted from the library allowing the client to\nprovide their own backing storage for the log in the fashion of their choosing.\nA Raft type is now provided to the consuming application which\ndramatically simplifies client communication with the cluster. As a result of\nthis, all client requests require a network trip, but in the vast majority of\ncases, this was required regardless, since all client requests must go to the\nleader.\nThe State Machine abstraction has been improved in order to facilitate\nmore useful consumption of the library. The first prototype's interface was\ndetermined to be insufficient to provide things like Log Compaction, an\noptional feature of Raft, in the future.\n\nThis changes are still not done, as they have required a considerable amount of work, both on our code and on upstream libraries.\nAs a result of this project, several pull requests to upstream projects have\nbeen created and merged.\nMerged pull requests by Dan Burkert:\n\nimpl ::std::error::Error for capnp::Error\nImplement std::error::Error for std::sync::mpsc error types\n\nMerged pull requests by Ana Hobden:\n\nMove to &amp;mut s[..] syntax\nUpdate std::error example\nAdd Read and Write to RingBuf\nAdd docs for NonBlock&lt;TcpListener&gt;::accept()\nImplement collect()\nDerive not Deriving\n\nThanks\nAt this time I'd like to personally extend thanks to the following people:\n\nDavid Renshaw (@dwrensha)\nCarl Lerche (@carllerche)\nDan Burkert (@danburkert)\n\nFor their professionalism, mentorship, and community involvement. One of my favorite things about the Rust community is just how great it is. Stop by on IRC sometime!\nI'm having a tremendous amount of fun on this project and I'm learning so much. I can't wait to wrap up my semester to get back to work on Raft!\n\nYou can get involved with Raft here. Or join the Reddit discussion here.\n\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-the-next-generation-3/","title":"Raft: Status Update"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-tooling/":{"body":"In preparation for the forthcoming 0.0.1 release of Raft we've taken several forward steps to improve our (already pretty darn cool!) tooling and infrastructure. If you attempt to set up any of these on your own and have issues let me know! I'd be more than happy to help. You can find our .travis.yml here.\nsudo-less\nTravis CI released their container infrastructure last year, and we finally started using it! We'd tried before however we struggled with packages, as Cap'n Proto has rather demanding dependencies for a C++11 compiler.\nIn case anyone is looking, here is the secret sauce on how to build Cap'n Proto on Travis CI without root:\naddons:\n  apt:\n    sources:\n      - ubuntu-toolchain-r-test\n    packages:\n        # Needed for building Cap'n Proto.\n      - gcc-4.8\n      - g++-4.8\n\n# We need to install Cap'n Proto.\ninstall:\n    - git clone https://github.com/kentonv/capnproto.git\n    - cd capnproto/c++\n    - ./setup-autotools.sh\n    - autoreconf -i\n    - ./configure --disable-shared\n    - make -j5\n    - export PATH=\"$PATH:$(pwd)\"\n    - export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$(pwd)\"\n    -  cd ../..\n\nNow that we've flagged sudo: false in our .travis.yml our Travis wait time for a build have significantly decreased. Some of our test builds take under 1:45 minutes!\nMoved to travis-cargo\nHuon created the fantastic travis-cargo crate and we recently moved over to it! This helped clean up the .travis.yml a bit and opened the door for us to utilize future improvements. This took our .travis.yml script section from this:\n# Generate Docs\nafter_success = \"|\"\n  [ $TRAVIS_BRANCH = master ] &amp;&amp;\n  [ $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST = false ] &amp;&amp;\n  cargo doc &amp;&amp;\n  echo '&lt;meta http-equiv=refresh content=0;url=raft/index.html&gt;' &gt; target/doc/index.html &amp;&amp;\n  sudo pip install ghp-import &amp;&amp;\n  ghp-import -n target/doc &amp;&amp;\n  git push -fq https://${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/${TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG}.git gh-pages\n\nTo this:\n# Load `travis-cargo`\nbefore_script:\n    - pip install 'travis-cargo' --user\n    - export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\n\nscript:\n    - travis-cargo build\n    - travis-cargo test\n    - travis-cargo bench\n    - travis-cargo doc\n\n# Generate Docs and coverage\nafter_success:\n    - travis-cargo doc-upload\n    - travis-cargo coveralls --no-sudo\n\nWith travis-cargo our builds are more thorough, clear, and featured. It handles uploading our documentation, code coverage, benchmarking, and the whole kaboodle.\nCode Coverage\nYou may have noticed the travis-cargo coveralls --no-sudo above and wondered what that was. http://coveralls.io/ offers free code coverage analysis to open source projects. You can see what ours looks like here.\nWe're currently sitting at:\n\nCode coverage. Wow! That's not bad! We hope to improve this as we go.\n@homu\nWe also adopted the friendly robot homu to be our repository gatekeeper. If you've been around Rust or Servo you probably know bors, homu is a rewrite of bors.\nhomu acts sort of like a pre-commit hook, testing pull requests just before they're merged. Much of the work to get sudo-less builds was in preparation for homu since we wanted it to be fast!\nWith homu guarding the master branch we can be sure that Raft will stay \"green\" on tests unless I manage to accidently push to master, or one of our dependencies breaks.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-tooling/","title":"Raft: Tooling & Infra Update"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-update-1/":{"body":"\nTL;DR: I've made Hoverbear/raft publicly available (It's still not ready)! Feel encouraged to contribute feedback or code via Github or email!\n\nProgress\nI've been working hard on building a sane, reasonable scaffolding for the codebase. Last post I talked about my first 'go' at designing the data structures and interfaces for the library, here I'll talk a bit about what's changed and why.\nData Interchange\nProbably one of the most interesting (and meaningful) changes I've made was moving my previous enum structs into seperate enums and structs.\nSimply, this:\nenum ClientRequest&lt;T&gt; {\n    IndexRange {\n        start_index: u64,\n        end_index: u64,\n    },\n    AppendEntries {\n        prev_log_index: u64,\n        prev_log_term: T,\n        entries: Vec&lt;T&gt;,\n    },\n}\n\nBecame this:\n#[derive(RustcEncodable, RustcDecodable, Debug, Clone)]\npub enum ClientRequest&lt;T&gt; {\n    /// Gets the log entries from start to end.\n    IndexRange(IndexRange),\n    /// Asks the node to append an entry after a given entry.\n    AppendRequest(AppendRequest&lt;T&gt;),\n}\n\n#[derive(RustcEncodable, RustcDecodable, Debug, Clone, Copy)]\npub struct IndexRange {\n    pub start_index: u64,\n    pub end_index: u64,\n}\n\n#[derive(RustcEncodable, RustcDecodable, Debug, Clone)]\npub struct AppendRequest&lt;T&gt; {\n    pub prev_log_index: u64,\n    pub prev_log_term: T,\n    pub entries: Vec&lt;T&gt;,\n}\n\nSo... Why? A couple of reasons actually:\n\nEnum structs take the memory of their biggest variant. This is a minor concern to me as most of my structs are just a few values large, but I understand how this can have an effect and I'd like to follow best practices. (The change made did not benefit from this. See this comment by Quxxy)\nYou lose type safety. There is no way to create a function that will only accept a single variant of an enum. You can't, for example, say fn foo(bar: Option::None) {}. Moving to seperate structs means that the compiler can check to make sure the right data is being passed into the right functions.\n\nWhat's the downside? Creating a new AppendRequest without the use of a helper function can look a little gross: ClientRequest::AppendRequest(AppendRequest { ... })\nBut a helper can mask this grossness:\nimpl&lt;T&gt; ClientRequest&lt;T&gt; {\n    /// Returns (term, success)\n    pub fn index_range(start: u64, end: u64) -&gt; ClientRequest&lt;T&gt; {\n        ClientRequest::IndexRange(IndexRange {\n            start_index: start,\n            end_index: end,\n        })\n    }\n\n    /// Returns (term, voteGranted)\n    pub fn append_request(prev_log_index: u64, prev_log_term: T, entries: Vec&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; ClientRequest&lt;T&gt; {\n        ClientRequest::AppendRequest(AppendRequest {\n            prev_log_index: prev_log_index,\n            prev_log_term: prev_log_term,\n            entries: entries\n        })\n    }\n}\nInterfacing\nA RaftNode now is spawned via the following function\npub fn start (id: u64, nodes: Vec&lt;(u64, SocketAddr)&gt;) -&gt;\n(Sender&lt;ClientRequest&lt;T&gt;&gt;, Receiver&lt;Result&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;, String&gt;&gt;)\n\nWell isn't that a long function signature? Basically, once you spawn a RaftNode it gets immediately moved into it's own thread and you are given a pair of channels to talk to it over. You send ClientRequests and get back the rather familiar Result type. In the future it might be beneficial to expose something other than channels, but currently I think that's the best choice.\n\nI'm still wrangling ownership and borrowing, as I think many Rust users are, and some of my design choices are specifically because I wanted to avoid friction for now.\n\nSince I've not been a user of any of the other Raft implementations out there (other than a bit of playing with etcd) I don't have much of a basis to go off what's a \"nice\" interface. My goal is to remove as much of the complexities and management of the library from the user as possible. Ideally once they start their RaftNodes they'll only need to worry about sending requests and getting responses.\nEvent Loop\nI took a look at mio which looks fantastic, however for the time being I'm still just doing an infinite loop as I'd like to keep dependencies down until Rust stabilizes a bit more. In the future using some sort of evented system would definitely be ideal.\nExperience\nDecoding Socket Data\nI had all sorts of fun implementing the following code in the loop's main tick() function:\nmatch self.socket.recv_from(&amp;mut read_buffer) {\n    Ok((num_read, source)) =&gt; { // Something on the socket.\n        // This is possibly an RPC from another node. Try to parse it out\n        // and determine what to do based on it's variant.\n        let data = str::from_utf8(&amp;mut read_buffer[.. num_read])\n            .unwrap();\n        if let Ok(rpc) = json::decode::&lt;RemoteProcedureCall&lt;T&gt;&gt;(data) {\n            match rpc {\n                RemoteProcedureCall::RequestVote(call) =&gt;\n                    self.handle_request_vote(call, source),\n                RemoteProcedureCall::AppendEntries(call) =&gt;\n                    self.handle_append_entries(call, source),\n            }\n        } else if let Ok(rpr) = json::decode::&lt;RemoteProcedureResponse&gt;(data) {\n            match rpr {\n                RemoteProcedureResponse::Accepted { .. } =&gt;\n                    self.handle_accepted(rpr, source),\n                RemoteProcedureResponse::Rejected { .. } =&gt;\n                    self.handle_rejected(rpr, source),\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    Err(_) =&gt; (),                 // Nothing on the socket.\n}\n\nThis was the first time I used if let and it was very useful for destructuring in control flow. I'm looking forward to using while let soon.\nWhat does that code do... exactly? When we recieve data from the network, it's either going to be a RemoteProcedureCall, a RemoteProcedureResponse, or something else entirely. Currently, I only account for the valid cases, the third case is outright ignored.\nDealing with the State (Machine)\nI read this gist with great interest, however I've yet to determine how to go about implementing a truly type-safe state machine for Raft right now. I'd like to do this in the future, and I'd be thrilled if someone could help with advice, mentorship, or pull requests on how to accomplish this.\nCurrently, all of the data event handlers look roughly like this:\nfn handle_append_request(&amp;mut self, request: AppendRequest&lt;T&gt;) {\n    match self.state {\n        Leader(ref state) =&gt; {\n            unimplemented!();\n        },\n        Follower =&gt; {\n            unimplemented!();\n        },\n        Candidate =&gt; {\n            unimplemented!();\n        },\n    }\n}\nDealing with Non-Pollables\nOne thing I noticed while working with Rust's UdpSocket imeplementation is there is no way to poll() the socket to see if there is data, so any time the socket is checked you must handle the data immediately. I'm currently avoiding having FIFO queues for the various data but that might end up being a requirement.\nFor those wondering, you can make a socket non-blocking by using this:\nlet mut socket = UdpSocket::bind(own_socket_addr)\n    .unwrap();\nsocket.set_read_timeout(Some(0));\nThoughts\nWorking with Rust has been really fun. (Except when there is a breaking change which cascades through libraries and means you lose productivity.)\nmatch expressions are incredible things. If you haven't played around with Rust yet, they're so much more than a switch statement in your run of the mill language.\nAPI design in Rust is very versatile and interesting. The strong typing and ownership system encourage you to work with data in sane and creative ways.\nUnderstanding your code is emphasized in Rust far more than a language like Javascript. Understanding where your borrows come from, what lifetimes are applicable, etc are all valuable to you.\nSmart data structures and dumb code are better than vice versa... and I think that Rust really helps with that.\nExplore and Help!\n\nhttps://github.com/Hoverbear/raft\n\nWould you like to explore, give feedback, or contribute? Please do! Publicly you can just make an issue on Github, or privately just shoot me an email. (I'm sure you can find it on Github or here...)\nDiscussion of this post is on Reddit.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-update-1/","title":"Raft Experiences and Repo Made Public!"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-update-2/":{"body":"I've spent the majority of my free time this last week working on Raft. As you can see from this issue I've been mostly working on the idea of transactions.\nA lot has taken shape in the codebase. It still will panic at unimplemented!() about 300ms after you start a node, but \"That's a feature!\"\n\nNote: All interfaces and code are not final, and are for educational and interest purposes.\n\nHacking up a Persistent Log\nProbably one of the coolest little projects I worked on was writing the persistent_state of a RaftNode. This is the data that the Raft protocol requires be written on stable storage each update.\n/// Persistent state\n/// **Must be updated to stable storage before RPC response.**\npub struct PersistentState&lt;T: Encodable + Decodable + Send + Clone&gt; {\n    current_term: u64,\n    voted_for: Option&lt;u64&gt;,      // request_vote cares if this is `None`\n    log: File,\n    last_index: u64,             // The last index of the file.\n}\n\nSo, the reason this needs to be written to disk is so that in theory if we have a crash, we can recover. I haven't implemented resuming from a previous log, but I think that'll be a fun thing to do.\nHere's what a log looks like right now:\n➜  raft git:(master) ✗ cat /tmp/test_path\n                   0                    0\n1 IkZvbyI\n2 IkJhciI\n\nThe first line is where we store current_term and voted_for (in that order). All previous lines are pairs of $term  $V where V is the base64 encoded JSON encoded version of T, which is anything that implemented Decode and Encode.\n\nI'd really like to not Base64 encode JSON encoded data. If you have a suggestion, please open an issue! I'm currently looking at using bincode instead. See this issue.\n\nMy reasoning for what V looks like is that I'm using \\n to delimit index entries for the log, so any sort of output that I store can't have any \\n symbols. In theory I could sanitize my input, but I'd argue that the cost of sanitization would be less than just Base64 encoding it.\nOn New Toys\nAfter using them, new fs and io modules are pretty sweet (At the time of writing this is rustc 1.0.0-nightly (b63cee4a1 2015-02-14 17:01:11 +0000)).\nWorking with the new Result&lt;T&gt; was a bit weird as we used to use Result&lt;T,E&gt;. The new Result&lt;T&gt; handles almost identical in my experience (and you don't need to specify long errors in every function definition!).\nCreating Files\nThis was, surprisingly, a bit of a stumbling block for me. File::open() gives you read access, while File::create() gives you write, but if you're hoping to open a file then read and write to it, you'll need to use OpenOptions.\nlet mut open_opts = OpenOptions::new();\nopen_opts.read(true);\nopen_opts.write(true);\nopen_opts.create(true);\nlet mut file = open_opts.open(&amp;log_path).unwrap();\nManipulating Files\nWorking with files means you generally deal with Cursors into the file. You can navigate around a file like so:\nlet start =\n\tself.log.seek(io::SeekFrom::Start(0));\nlet offset_from_start =\n\tself.log.seek(io::SeekFrom::Start(8));\nlet very_end =\n\tself.log.seek(io::SeekFrom::End(0));\nlet current =\n\tself.log.seek(io::SeekFrom::Current(0));\n\nThis is key, because it controls your position in the file for most other operations. You can try it out with the code below on the playpen.\n#![feature(io)]\n#![feature(fs)]\n#![feature(path)]\nuse std::fs::OpenOptions;\nuse std::io::{Read, Write, Seek, SeekFrom};\nfn main() {\n    let mut open_opts = OpenOptions::new();\n    open_opts.read(true);\n    open_opts.write(true);\n    open_opts.create(true);\n    let mut file = open_opts.open(&amp;Path::new(\"/tmp/test\")).unwrap();\n    let mut read = String::new();\n\n    write!(&amp;mut file, \"Foo bar baz\").unwrap();\n    file.seek(SeekFrom::End(-3)).unwrap();\n    file.read_to_string(&amp;mut read).unwrap();\n    println!(\"{}\", read); // Outputs \"baz\"\n\n    read = String::new();\n\n    file.seek(SeekFrom::End(-7)).unwrap();\n    write!(&amp;mut file, \"dog\").unwrap();\n    file.seek(SeekFrom::Start(0)).unwrap();\n    file.read_to_string(&amp;mut read).unwrap();\n    println!(\"{}\", read); // Outputs \"Foo dog baz\"\n}\n\nNow that we can write into files, how do we make sure we have a consistent space for data? The first line of our log contains two u64s which can take up to 20 digits each. Using this, we can modify our write!() call to use more specialize formatting options.\nwrite!(&amp;mut self.log, \"{:20} {:20}\\n\",\n\tself.current_term, self.voted_for.unwrap_or(0))\n\nThe {:20} is a formatting option that ensures it takes up consistent space. More on that here.\nScanning Through\nSince we have a handle on moving around our file cursor we can start using other things like .chars() on the file to get it to spit out characters.\n\nMake sure to .seek() then build your iterator, otherwise ownership woes will be upon you!\n\n/// Moves `line` lines into the file. Purposefully goes \"one extra\" line because the first line is metadata.\n/// Returns the number of bytes containing `line` lines.\nfn move_to(&amp;mut self, line: u64) -&gt; io::Result&lt;u64&gt; {\n    // Gotcha: The first line is NOT a log entry.\n    let mut lines_read = 0u64;\n    self.log.seek(io::SeekFrom::Start(0)); // Take the start.\n    // Go until we've reached `line` new lines.\n    let _ = self.log.by_ref().chars().skip_while(|opt| {\n        match *opt {\n            Ok(val) =&gt; {\n                if val == '\\n' {\n                    lines_read += 1;\n                    if lines_read &gt; line { // Greater than here because the first line is a bust.\n                        false // At right location.\n                    } else {\n                        true // Not done yet, more lines to go.\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    true // Not a new line.\n                }\n            },\n            _ =&gt; false // At EOF. Nothing more.\n        }\n    }).next(); // Side effects.\n    self.log.seek(io::SeekFrom::Current(0)) // Where are we?\n}\n\nAs you can see, the move_to() function's main traversing is not done by seek(), it's done by an iterator! Once we set the cursor to Start(0) we can set up an iterator with log.by_ref().chars().skip_while(). by_ref() gets us a reference so we don't stumble into move issues. .chars() lets us pull char types instead of u8. .skip_while() lets us walk over the file, disgarding values as we finish looking at them.\nFinally, at the end you might notice a .next(), this is because iterators are lazy... So up until that's called, nothing is actually even done! Very neat.\nLooking forward, I'd like to not require going from the start forward every .move_to() call.\nRetrieving an Entry\nNow that we can effectively scan through the file and get the correct position, how do we retrieve entries? Here is what retrieve_entry looks like (Note there is retrieve_entries too which is very similar):\npub fn retrieve_entry(&amp;mut self, index: u64) -&gt; io::Result&lt;(u64, T)&gt; {\n    // Move to the correct line.\n    let position = self.move_to(index);\n    let mut chars = self.log.by_ref()\n        .chars()\n        // Only go until the end of the file, `None`\n        .take_while(|val| val.is_ok())\n        // Drop anything not `Some(val)`\n        .filter_map(|val| val.ok())\n        // Take the line.\n        .take_while(|&amp;val| val != '\\n')\n        // Bring it into a String.\n        .collect::&lt;String&gt;();\n    let mut splits = chars.split(' ');\n    // Use a scope!\n    let term = {\n        // `.and_then()` is great for dealing with Options.\n        let chunk = splits.next()\n            .and_then(|v| v.parse::&lt;u64&gt;().ok());\n        match chunk {\n            Some(v) =&gt; v,\n            None =&gt; return Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::InvalidInput, \"Could not parse term.\", None)),\n        }\n    };\n    let encoded = {\n        let chunk = splits.next();\n        match chunk {\n            Some(v) =&gt; v,\n            None =&gt; return Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::InvalidInput, \"Could not parse encoded data.\", None)),\n        }\n    };\n    // Decode the value.\n    let decoded: T = PersistentState::decode(encoded.to_string())\n        .ok().expect(\"Could not unwrap log entry.\");\n    Ok((term, decoded))\n}\n\nThis code makes use of iterators, scopes, and options in, what I consider, a fairly clean way. After moving to the correct line, chars takes in one line of the file and it gets chunked into two pieces along a delimiter. Then the values of that chunk iterator are parsed.\nOne stumbling block I had was that v.parse::&lt;u64&gt;() returned &lt;F as FromStr&gt;::Err instead of an IoError like io::Result&lt;_&gt; expects. This means that I couldn't just try!() the expression. Looking at io::Error I was able to find the InvalidInput variant that suited my needs.\nPurging and Appending\nPart of the Raft protocol dictates that purging and appending must be able to happen to the log. Here's purge:\n/// Do *not* invoke this unless you update the `last_index`!\nfn purge_from_bytes(&amp;mut self, from_bytes: u64) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    self.log.set_len(from_bytes) // Chop off the file at the given position.\n}\n/// Removes all entries from `from` to the last entry, inclusively.\npub fn purge_from_index(&amp;mut self, from_line: u64) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let position = try!(self.move_to(from_line));\n    self.last_index = from_line - 1;\n    self.purge_from_bytes(position)\n}\n\nSince purging will always remove all lines after a given line, we can just use .set_len(), which is convienent since otherwise the only real way I've seen to remove \"some\" lines is to read in the file and write it back out again entirely, which kind of sucks.\nI split purge_from_bytes() and purge_from_index() up because append_entries() will use it. Here it is:\n/// Appends `entries` after `prev_log_index` and `prev_log_term`.\npub fn append_entries(&amp;mut self, prev_log_index: u64, prev_log_term: u64,\n                      entries: Vec&lt;(u64, T)&gt;) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    // TODO: No checking of `prev_log_index` &amp; `prev_log_term` yet... Do we need to?\n    let position = try!(self.move_to(prev_log_index + 1));\n    let number = entries.len();\n    try!(self.purge_from_bytes(position)); // Update `last_log_index` later.\n    for (term, entry) in entries {\n        // TODO: I don't like the \"doubling\" here. How can we do this better?\n        write!(&amp;mut self.log, \"{} {}\\n\", term, PersistentState::encode(entry));\n    }\n    self.last_index = if prev_log_index == 0 {\n        number as u64 - 1\n    } else { prev_log_index + number as u64 };\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nYou'll notice the first line is a // TODO: because there are no safety checks to make sure that things are as they should be. The semantics of these checks are specified in the Raft paper, and should be easy to implement, I just haven't gotten to it yet! (Midterm week, yuck!) Otherwise, the code for this is fairly straightforward.\nTesting\nOne of my favorite things about Rust is the built in tooling for testing. Here's what the start of my log test looks like:\n#[test]\nfn test_persistent_state() {\n    let path = Path::new(\"/tmp/test_path\");\n    fs::remove_file(&amp;path.clone());\n    let mut state = PersistentState::new(0, path.clone());\n    // Add 0, 1\n    assert_eq!(state.append_entries(0, 0,\n        vec![(0, \"Zero\".to_string()),\n             (1, \"One\".to_string())]),\n        Ok(()));\n    // Check index.\n    assert_eq!(state.get_last_index(), 1);\n    // Check 0\n    assert_eq!(state.retrieve_entry(0),\n        Ok((0, \"Zero\".to_string())));\n    // Check 0, 1\n    assert_eq!(state.retrieve_entries(0, 1),\n        Ok(vec![(0, \"Zero\".to_string()),\n                (1, \"One\".to_string())\n        ]));\n    // ...\n\nLet me be clear I love this. It makes it so easy to unit test code. One gotcha I discovered is that cargo test captures all your stdout... So you can do cargo test -- --nocapture to disable that!\nExplore and Help!\n\nhttps://github.com/Hoverbear/raft\n\nWould you like to explore, give feedback, or contribute? Please do!

But with that said, the work has only really just begun.\nCurrently:\n\nElections: Works (most of the time)!\n\nThere are corner cases where two nodes will contend for votes and occasionally lock up. I haven't managed to track this down yet.\n\n\nReplicating Logs: Works, but isn't ideal!\n\nAs I wrote about in my last article the current scheme isn't very intelligent.\nThis issue is tracking possible improvements.\n\n\nHandling Commits: Works!\nInterfacing with Consumers: Works, but needs more love!\n\nThe API simply isn't very nice. Since I haven't gotten around to actually using Raft for anything serious I don't have a great idea about the desired interface.\n\n\nSafety: Sort of!\n\nThere is (predictably) no unsafe code in Raft.\nThere are several .unwrap() statements in places were, for now, I just want the code to panic.\nOverflows aren't handled gracefully.\n\n\nEfficiency: Needs love!\nTesting:: In progress!\nTooling: Rocks!\n\nTravis CI Builds\nGenerated Docs\n\n\n\nArchitecture So Far\n{&lt;1&gt;}\nEach RaftNode runs on it's own thread alongside of the consuming program. The consumer program communicates along channels, sending ClientRequest&lt;T&gt; and recieving (at the moment) io::Result&lt;T&gt;.\nA RaftNode talks to other RaftNodes via UdpSockets using RemoteProcedureCall&lt;T&gt; and RemoteProcedureResponse messages.\n\nNote: I'm going to avoid talking about things I have already talked about in previous writings.\n\nCurrent Dependencies\nWith Rust still pre-beta, and my deadline for this prototype short, I wanted to reduce the number of dependencies to a minimum to avoid deadlocking. Please keep this in mind as you read forward as it was a primary consideration for some functionality like RPC.\n\nstd - The stdlib.\nrustc-serialize - Generic serialization/deserialization support.\nuuid - Unique Universal Identifiers.\nrand - Random number generators.\nlog - Configurable logging.\nenv_logger - For log.\n\nStates\nNodes can either be:\n\nA Follower, which replicates AppendEntries requests and votes for it's leader.\n\nStores a log of it's recent requests of the Leader on behalf of the consumer.\n\n\nA Leader, which leads the cluster by serving incoming requests, ensuring data is replicated, and issuing heartbeats.\n\nStores match_index and next_index which are both Vec&lt;u64&gt; and specified by the Raft paper.\n\n\nA Candidate, which campaigns in an election and may become a Leader (if it gets enough votes) or a Follower, if it hears from a Leader.\n\nStores a Vec&lt;Transcation&gt; to keep track of it's RequestVote requests.\n\n\n\nThe resulting enum looks like:\n#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Clone)]\npub enum NodeState {\n    Follower(VecDeque&lt;Transaction&gt;),\n    Leader(LeaderState),\n    Candidate(Vec&lt;Transaction&gt;),\n}\n\nThese variants all store their one specific data needed for only their operation. Changing between state clears all of the data.\nTransactions\nTransactions are used to track the state of a variety of things in the library. They look like this:\n#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Clone)]\npub struct Transaction {\n    pub uuid: Uuid,\n    pub state: TransactionState,\n}\n#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Copy, Clone)]\npub enum TransactionState {\n    Polling,\n    Accepted,\n    Rejected,\n}\n\nThe idea is that when a RemoteProcedureRequest is made it generates a UUID which the RaftNode (particularly it's node.state) stores and uses to verify and identify responses.\nIn the case of AppendEntries there is no need for the Leader(_) to track UUIDs. They are mostly used for Candidate(_) elections and for the Follower(_) when it makes a request of the leader.\nI'm not entirely happy with this approach, and I think that in the future moving to some form of RPC approach like Cap'n Proto would be safer and faster.\n\nMoving to Cap'n Proto might serve two additional purposes: Increased compatability with other implementations, and providing examples (which are currently lacking for Rust!)\n\nThe Tick\nCurrently, most of the work done by tick() which runs a loop.\nloop { raft_node.tick(); }\n\nNow you're probably thinking \"Oh gosh why?\" and I totally agree with you. Ideally, we would use something like epoll. However, I wanted to simulate an event loop and hopefully move to mio soon, but it's undergoing a reform so I'm holding off on that for a bit, there is plenty more to do!\nIf you have any advice on this, let me know here.\nMain Events\nThere are three main events which can occur:\n\nThe socket has data: Parse the data into a RemoteProcedureCall or a RemoteProcedureResponse and handles it appropriately.\nThe timer has fired: (Re)Start an election or heartbeat.\nThe channel has data: Act on the clients command if there is a known leader.\n\n\nGotcha: Only the Leader(_) or a Follower(_) (with a known leader) will retrieve from a channel for now.\n\nLogging\nI just started migrating over to the fantastic log crate, and I just love it. It provides numerous macros for logging levels like debug!(), info!(), log!().\nUsing it, you end up with something like this:\nif let Ok(rpc) = json::decode::&lt;RemoteProcedureCall&lt;T&gt;&gt;(data) {\n    debug!(\"ID {}: FROM {:?} RECIEVED {:?}\", self.own_id, source, rpc);\n      // ..\n    }\n\nAnd this:\nmatch checks.iter().all(|&amp;x| x) {\n    true  =&gt; {\n        self.persistent_state.set_voted_for(Some(source_id)).unwrap();\n        self.reset_timer();\n        info!(\"ID {}:F: TO {} ACCEPT request_vote\", self.own_id, source_id);\n        RemoteProcedureResponse::accept(call.uuid, current_term,\n            last_index, self.volatile_state.commit_index)\n    },\n\nAnd the user is able to toggle directives at runtime, which is awesome! So set the logging level while testing a crate you can use:\nRUST_LOG=raft=debug cargo test -- --nocapture\n\nOr use the same environment variable at runtime. You can even specifiy different log levels per crate. It's kind of neat to use a wildcard like RUST_LOG=debug with cargo because you actually see a considerable amount of compiler output.\nHere's what the test output looks like with the highest level of logging:\nrunning 1 test\nINFO:raft: ID 2: HANDLE timer\nDEBUG:raft: ID 2: FOLLOWER -&gt; CANDIDATE: Term 0\nDEBUG:raft: Node 2 timer RESET\nDEBUG:raft: Node 2 timer RESET\nDEBUG:raft: ID 2: SEND RequestVote(RequestVote { term: 1, candidate_id: 2, last_log_index: 0, last_log_term: 0, uuid: Uuid { bytes: [10, 1, 60, 118, 191, 114, 66, 35, 139, 241, 26, 177, 159, 117, 104, 222] } })\nDEBUG:raft: ID 2: SEND RequestVote(RequestVote { term: 1, candidate_id: 2, last_log_index: 0, last_log_term: 0, uuid: Uuid { bytes: [175, 43, 94, 204, 10, 194, 72, 149, 171, 80, 0, 233, 192, 112, 124, 210] } })\nDEBUG:raft: Node 2 timer RESET\nDEBUG:raft: ID 0: FROM SocketAddr { ip: Ipv4Addr(127, 0, 0, 1), port: 11112 } RECIEVED RequestVote(RequestVote { term: 1, candidate_id: 2, last_log_index: 0, last_log_term: 0, uuid: Uuid { bytes: [10, 1, 60, 118, 191, 114, 66, 35, 139, 241, 26, 177, 159, 117, 104, 222] } })\nDEBUG:raft: ID 1: FROM SocketAddr { ip: Ipv4Addr(127, 0, 0, 1), port: 11112 } RECIEVED RequestVote(RequestVote { term: 1, candidate_id: 2, last_log_index: 0, last_log_term: 0, uuid: Uuid { bytes: [175, 43, 94, 204, 10, 194, 72, 149, 171, 80, 0, 233, 192, 112, 124, 210] } })\nINFO:raft: ID 0: FROM 2 HANDLE request_vote\nINFO:raft: ID 1: FROM 2 HANDLE request_vote\nDEBUG:raft: Node 0 timer RESET\nINFO:raft: ID 0:F: TO 2 ACCEPT request_vote\nDEBUG:raft: Node 1 timer RESET\nDEBUG:raft: ID 0: TO SocketAddr { ip: Ipv4Addr(127, 0, 0, 1), port: 11112 } RESPONDS Accepted(Accepted { uuid: Uuid { bytes: [10, 1, 60, 118, 191, 114, 66, 35, 139, 241, 26, 177, 159, 117, 104, 222] }, term: 0, match_index: 0, next_index: 0 })\nINFO:raft: ID 1:F: TO 2 ACCEPT request_vote\nDEBUG:raft: ID 0: RESPOND Accepted(Accepted { uuid: Uuid { bytes: [10, 1, 60, 118, 191, 114, 66, 35, 139, 241, 26, 177, 159, 117, 104, 222] }, term: 0, match_index: 0, next_index: 0 })\nDEBUG:raft: ID 1: TO SocketAddr { ip: Ipv4Addr(127, 0, 0, 1), port: 11112 } RESPONDS Accepted(Accepted { uuid: Uuid { bytes: [175, 43, 94, 204, 10, 194, 72, 149, 171, 80, 0, 233, 192, 112, 124, 210] }, term: 0, match_index: 0, next_index: 0 })\nDEBUG:raft: ID 1: RESPOND Accepted(Accepted { uuid: Uuid { bytes: [175, 43, 94, 204, 10, 194, 72, 149, 171, 80, 0, 233, 192, 112, 124, 210] }, term: 0, match_index: 0, next_index: 0 })\nDEBUG:raft: ID 2: FROM SocketAddr { ip: Ipv4Addr(127, 0, 0, 1), port: 11110 } RECIEVED Accepted(Accepted { uuid: Uuid { bytes: [10, 1, 60, 118, 191, 114, 66, 35, 139, 241, 26, 177, 159, 117, 104, 222] }, term: 0, match_index: 0, next_index: 0 })\nINFO:raft: ID 2: FROM 0 HANDLE accepted\nDEBUG:raft: ID 2:C: FROM 0 MATCHED\n// ...\n\nOn the normal level:\n     Running target/lib-800267e679b6e5c6\n\nrunning 1 test\ntest basic_test ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured\nDealing with Failures\nMost failure modes are defined by the Raft paper, and I'm attempting to implement them the best I can. Currently there is an unimplemented!() section of the code I'm still working on figuring out the correct course of action.\nThe 'Demo'\n\nAs I mentioned, the interface with the consuming library is in need of rework, so it's not very clean.\n\nHere is the current most basic possible functioning hunk of code to fire up a cluster:\nlet nodes = vec![\n    (0, SocketAddr { ip: Ipv4Addr(127, 0, 0, 1), port: 11110 }),\n    (1, SocketAddr { ip: Ipv4Addr(127, 0, 0, 1), port: 11111 }),\n    (2, SocketAddr { ip: Ipv4Addr(127, 0, 0, 1), port: 11112 }),\n];\n// Create the nodes.\nlet (log_0_sender, log_0_reciever) = RaftNode::&lt;String&gt;::start(\n    0,\n    nodes.clone(),\n    Path::new(\"/tmp/test0\")\n);\nlet (log_1_sender, log_1_reciever) = RaftNode::&lt;String&gt;::start(\n    1,\n    nodes.clone(),\n    Path::new(\"/tmp/test1\")\n);\nlet (log_2_sender, log_2_reciever) = RaftNode::&lt;String&gt;::start(\n    2,\n    nodes.clone(),\n    Path::new(\"/tmp/test2\")\n);\n\nHere is the current code to make an append request and check that it at least got to the leader:\n// Make a test send to that port.\nlet test_command = ClientRequest::AppendRequest(AppendRequest {\n    entries: vec![\"foo\".to_string()],\n    prev_log_index: 0,\n    prev_log_term: 0,\n});\nlog_0_sender.send(test_command.clone()).unwrap();\n// Get the result.\nwait_a_second();\nlet event = log_0_reciever.try_recv()\n    .ok().expect(\"Didn't recieve in a reasonable time.\");\nassert!(event.is_ok()); // Workaround until we build a proper stream.\n\nHere is the how to check an for items in an index, notice the graceful failing of \"overasking\":\n// Test Index.\nlet test_index = ClientRequest::IndexRange(IndexRange {\n        start_index: 0,\n        end_index: 5,\n});\nlog_0_sender.send(test_index.clone()).unwrap();\nwait_a_second();\nlet result = log_0_reciever.try_recv()\n    .ok().expect(\"Didn't recieve in a reasonable time.\").unwrap();\n// We don't know what the term will be.\nassert_eq!(result, vec![(result[0].0, \"foo\".to_string())]);\nFurther Work\nA lot of further work is needed to make this library ready for action.

Please stay tuned...\nInteresting Links\n\nThe Raft site\nThe Secret Lives of Data - Raft\nRaft Paper\nRaft Dissertation\n\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft/","title":"Raft in Rust"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/reading-rust-function-signatures/":{"body":"In Rust, function signatures tell a story. Just from glancing at the signature of a function an experienced Rust user can tell much of the functions behaivor.\nIn this article we'll explore some signatures and talk about how to read them and extract information from them. While exploring, you can find many great function signature examples in the Rust API docs. You can play around on the Playpen.\nThis article assumes some knowledge of Rust, glossing over a bit of the book should be quite sufficient if you are lacking that but have programmed before.\n\nIf you're used to programming in something like Python or Javascript, this all may seem a bit foreign to you. I hope by the end of it that you're convinced this additional information is both a good thing, and that it is not something you often have in dynamically typed languages.\nIf you're used to C++, C, or the other systemsy languages hopefully this should all seem very familiar, despite the syntax differences. Ideally by the end of your article you'll think more about your function signatures as you write them!\nBaby Steps\nYour first function definition in Rust almost definitely looks like this:\nfn main() {}\n\nSo since you've already most likely wrote this let's start here!\n\nfn: is the syntax which tells Rust we're declaring a function.\nmain: is the name of the function. main is special because it's what the program invokes when built and run as a binary. Function names are always snake_case and not camelCase.\n(): Is the arguments list. In this case, main accepts no arguments.\n{}: Are the delimiters for the inside of a function. In this case, it's empty.\n\nSo what would we write for a function that does nothing useful?\nfn do_nothing_useful() {}\n\nGreat, now you too can do nothing useful!\nVisibility\nBy default, all functions are private and cannot be used outside of the module they are in. Making them usable by a different module is simple.\nmod dog {\n    fn private_function() {}\n    pub fn public_function() {}\n}\n\n// Optional to avoid `foo::`\nuse dog::public_function;\n\nfn main() {\n    dog::public_function();\n    // With `use`\n    public_function();\n}\n\nLike mutability, Rust is conservative in its assumptions about things like visibility. If you try to use a private function the compiler will let you know and help point you to where you need to make the function public.\nIf you have a function like foo::bar::baz::rad() in your project and want to make it usable as foo::rad() add pub use bar::baz::rad; to your foo module. This is called re-exporting.\nSimple Parameters\nNo longer happy with do_nothing_useful() you decide to adopt a dog. Good for you! Now you have a new problem, you have to walk it and play with it!\nfn walk_dog(dog_name: String) {}\nfn play_with(dog_name: String, game_name: String) {}\n\nParameters are declared variable_name: Type, and are comma seperated. But c'mon! Our dog is a lot more than just a String! Good news, you can use your own types too.\nstruct Dog;  // Let's not go overboard.\nstruct Game; // Simple types in demos!\n\nfn walk_dog(dog: Dog) {}\nfn play_with(dog: Dog, game: Game) {}\n\nGreat, looking better already. Let's get that awesome day started.\nfn main() {\n    let rover = Dog;\n    walk_dog(rover);\n\n    let fetch = Game;\n    play_with(rover, fetch); // Compiler Error!\n}\n\nWhoa whoa! That's a perfectly good day the compiler is totally ruining for us! Rover is going to be super sad.\nLet's look at the error:\n&lt;anon&gt;:11:15: 11:20 error: use of moved value: `rover`\n&lt;anon&gt;:11     play_with(rover, fetch);\n                        ^~~~~\n&lt;anon&gt;:9:14: 9:19 note: `rover` moved here because it has type `Dog`, which is non-copyable\n&lt;anon&gt;:9     walk_dog(rover);\n                      ^~~~~\n\nHere the compiler is telling us that rover was moved when we passed it into walk_dog(). That's because fn walk_dog(dog: Dog) {} accepts a Dog value and we haven't tell the compiler they are copyable! Values with Copy are implictly copied when passed to functions. You can make something Copy by adding #[derive(Copy)] above the declaration.\nWe're going to keep Dog not copyable because, gosh darnit, you can't copy dogs. So how do we fix this?\nWe could clone rover. But our Dog struct isn't Clone either! Clone means we can explicitly make a copy of an object. You can make something Clone just like you did as Copy. To clone our dog you can do rover.clone()\nBut really neither of those possible solutions solved the real problem: We want to walk and play with the same dog!\nBorrowing\n\nCan I borrow your dog?\n\nInstead of moving our Dog into the walk_dog() function we really just want to lend the function our Dog. When you walk your dog it (generally) ends up coming back to the house with you, right?\nRust uses &amp; to symbolize a borrow. Borrowing something tells the compiler that when the function is done the ownership of the value returns back to the caller.\nfn walk_dog(dog: &amp;Dog) {}\nfn play_with(dog: &amp;Dog, game: Game) {}\n\nThere are immutable borrows as well as mutable borrows (&amp;mut). You can have an immutable borrow passed to any number of things at once, and a mutable borrow only passed to one thing at a time. This provides data safety.\nSo our new borrowing functions don't really cut it, do they? We can't even mutate the Dog! Let's try anyways to see the error message.\nstruct Dog {\n    walked: bool\n}\n\nfn walk_dog(dog: &amp;Dog) {\n    dog.walked = true;\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let rover = Dog { walked: false };\n    walk_dog(&amp;rover);\n    assert_eq!(rover.walked, true);\n}\n\nAs we expected:\n&lt;anon&gt;:6:5: 6:22 error: cannot assign to immutable field `dog.walked`\n&lt;anon&gt;:6     dog.walked = true;\n             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n\nChanging the function signature to fn walk_dog(dog: &amp;mut Dog) {} and updating our main() we can solve this.\nfn main() {\n    let mut rover = Dog { walked: false };\n    walk_dog(&amp;mut rover);\n    assert_eq!(rover.walked, true);\n}\n\nAs you can see, the function signature tells the programmer if a value is mutable and if the value is consumed or referenced.\nReturning\nLet's revisit exactly how we get Rover, because thats how we can explore return types! Let's say we want a function adopt_dog() which takes a name and gives us a Dog.\nstruct Dog {\n    name: String,\n    walked: bool,\n}\n\nfn adopt_dog(name: String) -&gt; Dog {\n    Dog { name: name, walked: false }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let rover = adopt_dog(String::from(\"Rover\"));\n    assert_eq!(rover.name, \"Rover\");\n}\n\nSo the -&gt; Dog part of the function signature tells us that the function returns a Dog. Note that the name is moved in and given to the dog, not copied or cloned.\nInside Traits\nIf you're implementing functions in a trait you also have access the following two tools:\n\nThe Self return type which represents the current type.\nThe self parameter which specifies the borrowing/moving/mutability of the structure instance. In walk() below we take a mutable borrow, a bare self moves the value.\n\nAn example:\n// ... `Dog` struct from before.\nimpl Dog {\n    pub fn adopt(name: String) -&gt; Self {\n        Dog { name: name, walked: false }\n    }\n    pub fn walk(&amp;mut self) {\n        self.walked = true\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut rover = Dog::adopt(String::from(\"Rover\"));\n    assert_eq!(rover.name, \"Rover\");\n    rover.walk();\n    assert_eq!(rover.walked, true);\n}\nGenerics\nLet's face it, there are a lot of different kinds of dogs! But moreso, there are a lot of types of animals! Some of these we might want to walk too, like our Bear.\nGenerics let us do this. We can have a Dog and Bear struct that implement the Walk trait, then have a walk_pet() function accept any Walk traited structure!\nGenerics are specified to functions in between the name and the parameters using sharp brackets. The important thing to note about generics is when you're accepting a generic you may only use the functions from the constraints. This means that if you pass a Read to a function that wants Write, it still can't Read in it unless the constraints include it.\nstruct Dog { walked: bool, }\nstruct Bear { walked: bool, }\n\ntrait Walk {\n    fn walk(&amp;mut self);\n}\nimpl Walk for Dog {\n    fn walk(&amp;mut self) {\n        self.walked = true\n    }\n}\nimpl Walk for Bear {\n    fn walk(&amp;mut self) {\n        self.walked = true\n    }\n}\n\nfn walk_pet&lt;W: Walk&gt;(pet: &amp;mut W) {\n    // Try setting `pet.walked` here!\n    // You can't!\n    pet.walk();\n}\n\nfn walk_pet_2(pet: &amp;mut Walk) {\n    // Try setting `pet.walked` here!\n    // You can't!\n    pet.walk();\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut rover = Dog { walked: false, };\n    walk_pet(&amp;mut rover);\n    assert_eq!(rover.walked, true);\n}\n\nYou can also use a different where syntax as function signatures with complex generics can get rather long.\nfn walk_pet&lt;W&gt;(pet: &amp;mut W)\nwhere W: Walk {\n    pet.walk();\n}\n\nIf you have multiple generics you can comma seperate them in both cases. If you'd like more than one trait contraint you can use where W: Walk + Read or &lt;W: Walk + Read&gt;.\nfn stuff&lt;R, W&gt;(r: &amp;R, w: &amp;mut W)\nwhere W: Write, R: Read + Clone {}\n\nLook at all of the information you can derive from that function signature! It's not helpfully named but you can still tell almost for sure what it does!\nThere are also these crazy things called Associated Types which are used in stuff like Iterator. When being written in a signature you want to use something like Iterator&lt;Item=Dog&gt; to say an iterator of Dogs.\nPassing Functions\nSometimes it's desirable to pass functions into other functions. In Rust, accepting a function as an argument is fairly straightforward. Functions have traits and they are passed like generics!\n\nYou should definitely use the where syntax here.\n\nstruct Dog {\n    walked: bool\n}\n\nfn do_with&lt;F&gt;(dog: &amp;mut Dog, action: F)\nwhere F: Fn(&amp;mut Dog) {\n    action(dog);\n}\n\nfn walk(dog: &amp;mut Dog) {\n    dog.walked = true;\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut rover = Dog { walked: false, };\n    // Fn\n    do_with(&amp;mut rover, walk);\n    // Closure\n    do_with(&amp;mut rover, |dog| dog.walked = true);\n}\n\nFunctions in Rust implement traits which determine where (and how) they are passed:\n\nFnOnce - Takes a by-value reciever.\nFnMut - Takes a mutable reciever.\nFn - Takes a immutable reciever.\n\nA particular Stack Overflow answer summises the differences very well:\n\nA closure |...| ... will automatically implement as many of those as it can.\n\n\n\nAll closures implement FnOnce: a closure that can't be called once doesn't deserve the name. Note that if a closure only implements FnOnce, it can be called only once.\nClosures that don't move out of their captures implement FnMut, allowing them to be called more than once (if there is unaliased access to the function object).\nClosures that don't need unique/mutable access to their captures implement Fn, allowing them to be called essentially everywhere.\n\n\nEssentially, the differences between the different types is how they interact with their environment. In my experience, you only really need to worry about the distinction for Closures, which may capture variables in scope (in our above example, the main() function).\nHave no fear, though! The compiler messages when one type is provided when another are needed are very helpful!\nLifetimes\nSo, you're probably feeling pretty good about yourself right now. I mean, look at that scrollbar, it's almost to the bottom of the page! You'll be a Rust function signature master in no time!\nLet's finish up with a bit of talk about lifetimes because you'll eventually come across them and likely get quite confused.\n\nLet me be honest with you upfront here. Lifetimes are an arcane art to me. I used them a bit back in 0.7-0.10 and then I haven't really had to use them since. If you know really anything at all about them you're much more qualified to write this section than I am.\n\nModern Rust has a really robust and effective lifetime ellision which removes the vast majority of lifetime gymnastics we used to need to concern ourselves with. But when you do things can start to untangle.\nSo, if you start dealing with a lot of lifetimes, your first step should really be to sit back and think about it. Unless your code is quite complex it's quite likely you won't need to deal with lifetimes. If you're bumping into lifetimes in a simple example your notion of the problem is probably incorrect.\nHere is a function with lifetimes from Option's implementation.\nas_slice&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a self) -&gt; &amp;'a [T]\n\nLifetimes are denoted by the tick (') and given a name. In this case, 'a but they can also be things like 'burrito if you prefer inside jokes. Essentially what this is saying is:\n\nThe lifetime of the Option&lt;T&gt; this is called upon is the same as the lifetime of the returned [T]\n\nGreat! I'm really not qualified to write anymore about lifetimes but if you have anything to add let me know and I'll credit you for sure.\nChallenge Time\nBelow, you'll find a set of functions pulled from the standard library along with links to their documentation. Can you tell from their function signature what they do? (For added fun, I've removed the function name!)\n// In `File`\nfn name&lt;P: AsRef&lt;Path&gt;&gt;(path: P) -&gt; Result&lt;File&gt;\n\nSource\n// In `Option&lt;T&gt;`\nfn name&lt;E, T&gt;(self, err: E) -&gt; Result&lt;T, E&gt;\n\nSource\n// In `Iterator&lt;Item=T&gt;`\nfn name&lt;B: FromIterator&lt;Self::Item&gt;&gt;(self) -&gt; B\nwhere Self: Sized\n\nSource\n// In `Iterator&lt;Item=T&gt;`\nfn name&lt;B, F&gt;(self, init: B, f: F) -&gt; B\nwhere Self: Sized, F: FnMut(B, Self::Item) -&gt; B\n\nSource\n// In `Result&lt;T,E&gt;`\nfn name&lt;F, O: FnOnce(E) -&gt; F&gt;(self, op: O) -&gt; Result&lt;T, F&gt;\n\nSource\nI hope that went fantastically, I was just over here cheering you on!\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/reading-rust-function-signatures/","title":"Reading Rust Function Signatures"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/reflections-on-a-quarter-century/":{"body":"\nTwenty five years is a fairly long time, it turns out.\n\nStepping over the boundary for another year of life brings tends to bring about it a whirl of emotions, at least temporarily. Simultaneously the past, present, and future being about a poignant picture.\nI find myself deeply in such a situation, and I have been for a couple months now. I've taken time to reflect on what has happened, what is happening, and what is to come. A few things seemed worth sharing. They may not be relevant to your situation, be the best advice, or make sense to you, but they are what I have experienced.\n\nDon't take everyone seriously.\n\n\nThis goes two ways. First, just because someone is important, or homeless, or your boss, or a bit weird, or incredibly beautiful to you doesn't mean they aren't a human. Treat them like one. Protocol and formalities are important, but sharing this life with others is paramount. Second, everyone has many incredible ideas but few bring them to reality. When someone proposes something amazing to you consider are they serious about it? If you're not absolutely convinced don't commit.\n\nSeek meaningful, diverse work.\n\nMost of the work I've done in the last few years has been in the non-profit sector. It's not because of pay or stability of hours. Every 4 months my schedule changes because of school. My employers change and flow, what I do shifts. Some days I will work at multiple jobs for a few hours and attend classes. But the work I do is interesting, engaging, and fresh. Sometimes I teach, sometimes I design systems, sometimes I code web apps, sometimes I help coordinate important events and gatherings, sometimes I work on multimedia, sometimes I work with doctors, others times I work with government and nations, and others I work in culture.\nIt all brings about a feeling of wholeness. Life seems fluid, your curiousity is constantly engaged with new and different things.\n\nSpeak like you're right, listen like you're wrong.\n\nIt doesn't matter how right (or wrong) you are, if you don't agree with someone elses opinions respect them. They have different experiences than you! It doesn't matter how silly or outrageous they sound to you. Ask questions, don't try to prove them wrong. Tell them why their opinions are interesting. Don't argue with them. Be respectful, if they wish to know your opinion share it. Don't talk down to them. Be passionate about it, get excited, answer their questions no matter how stupid they might be.\nYou won't change their opinion if they don't feel respected. Even if you don't want to change their opinion you can handle the situation tactfully. If they are your friend you can still share friendship. Take time and learn about their opinion, they will take time to learn about yours. Enjoy your differences, they are just as important as our similarities.\n\nBe curious. Explore broadly\n\nI can tell you, with fairly high amounts of detail, the processes, procedures, and mechanisms with which a photograph is formed from the photons of light into the diodes in the screen of your computer on a website. This isn't because I studied for that specific goal, it's because I am curious and explore broadly. Try things, explore things, take them apart, put them back together, do it yourself. If you're a technologist this is doubly true, the field moves fast and you need to keep growing.\n\nShare a meal with people.\n\nWe all eat. Eating is a bonding experience. Learn the best restaurants where you are. Know a wide assortment, know what is good on the menu. Try things and places people suggest. Invite people to a meal if you haven't talked to them in awhile, or you haven't seen them outside of work. Enjoy the meal, make sure they do too. Learn about them, show empathy, ask questions, relate things. This is a key way to build relationships and friendships.\nBy the way, if they can't afford it at the time and you can, pay for theirs discretely. Don't make a big deal out of it. If they are a good friend you'll recieve something back in kind, you just might not recognize it.\n\nPay attention.\n\nLook at your surroundings, read world news, Don't watch T.V., read literature, talk to people.  The world we live in matters, what is happening is actually happening. Have an opinion, share it, refine it, be passionate about it.\n\nConsider the implications.\n\nA saying was shared with me, \"In every deliberation, we must consider the impact on the seventh generation... even if it requires having skin as thick as the bark of a pine.\"\n\nAccept that the more things change the more they stay the same.\n\nFriends come and go. Grandparents pass away. Parents grow older. Pets die. Everything is temporal. Accept what pain they may bring, let it hurt you, support those it also hurts. Grow from it, move on. New things will come, and they will go as well. New lives will be born, others will pass. That is the way of things. Don't let the fact that this happens ruin life.\n\nBlaze your own path, live a life you are proud of.\n\nThere may be a paved road ahead of you, or there may not even be a trail. Take a good path. Go about things in a good way. There may be a rough patch or a detour, don't scramble to get back on the path, adjust, find a better path. Don't give up.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/reflections-on-a-quarter-century/","title":"Reflections on a Quarter Century"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/rust-state-machine-pattern/":{"body":"Lately I've been thinking a lot about the patterns and structures which we program with. It's really wonderful to start exploring a project and see familiar patterns and styles which you've already used before. It makes it easier to understand the project, and empowers you to start working on the project faster.\nSometimes you're working on a new project and realize that you need to do something in the same way as you did in another project. This thing might not be a functionality or a library, it might not be something which you can encode into some clever macro or small crate. Instead, it may be simply a pattern, or a structural concept which addresses a problem nicely.\nOne interesting pattern that is commonly applied to problems is that of the 'State Machine'. Let's take some time to consider what exactly we mean when we say that, and why they're interesting.\n\n\nThroughout this post you can run all examples in the playground, I typically use 'Nightly' out of habit.\n\nFounding Our Concepts\nThere are a lot of resources and topical articles about state machines out there on the internet. Even more so, there are a lot of implementations of state machines.\nJust to get to this web page you used one. You can model TCP as a state machine. You can model HTTP requests with one too. You can model any regular language, such as a regex, as a state machine. They're everywhere, hiding inside things we use every day.\nSo, a State Machine is any 'machine' which has a set of 'states' and 'transitions' defined between them.\nWhen we talk about a machine we're referring to the abstract concept of something which does something. For example, your 'Hello World!' function is a machine. It is started and eventually outputs what we expect it to. Some model which you use to interact with your database is just the same. We'll regard our most basic machine simply as a struct that can be created and destroyed.\nstruct Machine;\n\nfn main() {\n  let my_machine = Machine; // Create.\n  // `my_machine` is destroyed when it falls out of scope below.\n}\n\nStates are a way to reason about where a machine is in its process. For example, we can think about a bottle filling machine as an example. The machine is in a 'waiting' state when it is waiting for a new bottle. Once it detects a bottle it moves to the 'filling' state. Upon detecting the bottle is filled it enters the 'done' state. After the bottle is left the machine we return to the 'waiting' state.\nA key takeaway here is that none of the states have any information relevant for the other states. The 'filling' state doesn't care how long the 'waiting' state waited. The 'done' state doesn't care about what rate the bottle was filled at. Each state has discrete responsibilities and concerns. The natural way to consider these variants is as an enum.\nenum BottleFillerState {\n  Waiting { waiting_time: std::time::Duration },\n  Filling { rate: usize },\n  Done,\n}\n\nstruct BottleFiller {\n  state: BottleFillerState,\n}\n\nUsing an enum in this way means all the states are mutually exclusive, you can only be in one at a time. Rust's 'fat enums' allow us to have each of these states to carry data with them as well. As far as our current definition is concerned, everything is totally okay.\nBut there is a bit of a problem here. When we described our bottle filling machine above we described three transitions: Waiting -&gt; Filling, Filling -&gt; Done, and Done -&gt; Waiting. We never described Waiting -&gt; Done or Done -&gt; Filling, those don't make sense!\nThis brings us to the idea of transitions. One of the nicest things about a true state machine is we never have to worry about our bottle machine going from Done -&gt; Filling, for example. The state machine pattern should enforce that this can never happen. Ideally this would be done before we even start running our machine, at compile time.\nLet's look again at the transitions we described for our bottle filler in a diagram:\n  +++++++++++   +++++++++++   ++++++++\n  |         |   |         |   |      |\n  | Waiting +--&gt;+ Filling +--&gt;+ Done |\n  |         |   |         |   |      |\n  ++++-++++-+   +++++++++++   +--+++++\n       ^                         |\n       +++++++++++++++++++++++++-+\n\nAs we can see here there are a finite number of states, and a finite number of transitions between these states. Now, it is possible to have a valid transition between each state and every other state, but in most cases this is not true.\nThis means moving between a state such as 'Waiting' to a state such as 'Filling' should have defined semantics. In our example this can be defined as \"There is a bottle in place.\" In the case of a TCP stream it might be \"We have received a FIN packet\" which means we need to finish closing out the stream.\nDetermining What We Want\nNow that we know what a state machine is, how do we represent them in Rust? First, let's think about what we want from some pattern.\nIdeally, we'd like to see the following characteristics:\n\nCan only be in one state at a time.\nEach state should able have its own associated values if required.\nTransitioning between states should have well defined semantics.\nIt should be possible to have some level of shared state.\nOnly explicitly defined transitions should be permitted.\nChanging from one state to another should consume the state so it can no longer be used.\nWe shouldn't need to allocate memory for all states. No more than largest sized state certainly\nAny error messages should be easy to understand.\nWe shouldn't need to resort to heap allocations to do this. Everything should be possible on the stack.\nThe type system should be harnessed to our greatest ability.\nAs many errors as possible should be at compile-time.\n\nSo if we could have a design pattern which allowed for all these things it'd be truly fantastic. Having a pattern which allowed for most would be pretty good too.\nExploring Possible Implementation Options\nWith a type system as powerful and flexible as Rusts we should be able to represent this. The truth is: there are a number of ways to try, each has valuable characteristics, and each teaches us lessons.\nA Second Shot with Enums\nAs we saw above the most natural way to attempt this is an enum, but we noted already that you can't control which transitions are actually permitted in this case. So can we just wrap it? We sure can! Let's take a look:\nenum State {\n    Waiting { waiting_time: std::time::Duration },\n    Filling { rate: usize },\n    Done\n}\n\nstruct StateMachine { state: State }\n\nimpl StateMachine {\n    fn new() -&gt; Self {\n        StateMachine {\n            state: State::Waiting { waiting_time: std::time::Duration::new(0, 0) }\n        }\n    }\n    fn to_filling(&amp;mut self) {\n        self.state = match self.state {\n            // Only Waiting -&gt; Filling is valid.\n            State::Waiting { .. } =&gt; State::Filling { rate: 1 },\n            // The rest should fail.\n            _ =&gt; panic!(\"Invalid state tranistion!\"),\n        }\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut state_machine = StateMachine::new();\n    state_machine.to_filling();\n}\n\nAt first glance it seems okay. But notice some problems?\n\nInvalid transition errors happen at runtime, which is awful!\nThis only prevents invalid transitions outside of the module, since the private fields can be manipulated freely inside the module. For example, state_machine.state = State::Done is perfectly valid inside the module.\nEvery function we implement that works with the state has to include a match statement!\n\nHowever this does have some good characteristics:\n\nThe memory required to represent the state machine is only the size of the largest state. This is because a fat enum is only as big as its biggest variant.\nEverything happens on the stack.\nTransitioning between states has well defined semantics... It either works or it crashes!\n\nNow you might be thinking \"Hoverbear you could totally wrap the to_filling() output with a Result&lt;T,E&gt; or have an InvalidState variant!\" But let's face it: That doesn't make things that much better, if at all. Even if we get rid of the runtime failures we still have to deal with a lot of clumsiness with the match statements and our errors would still only be found at runtime! Ugh! We can do better, I promise.\nSo let's keep looking!\nStructures With Transitions\nSo what if we just used a set of structs? We could have them all implement traits which all states should share. We could use special functions that transitioned the type into the new type! How would it look?\n// This is some functionality shared by all of the states.\ntrait SharedFunctionality {\n    fn get_shared_value(&amp;self) -&gt; usize;\n}\n\nstruct Waiting {\n    waiting_time: std::time::Duration,\n    // Value shared by all states.\n    shared_value: usize,\n}\nimpl Waiting {\n    fn new() -&gt; Self {\n        Waiting {\n            waiting_time: std::time::Duration::new(0,0),\n            shared_value: 0,\n        }\n    }\n    // Consumes the value!\n    fn to_filling(self) -&gt; Filling {\n        Filling {\n            rate: 1,\n            shared_value: 0,\n        }\n    }\n}\nimpl SharedFunctionality for Waiting {\n    fn get_shared_value(&amp;self) -&gt; usize {\n        self.shared_value\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Filling {\n    rate: usize,\n    // Value shared by all states.\n    shared_value: usize,\n}\nimpl SharedFunctionality for Filling {\n    fn get_shared_value(&amp;self) -&gt; usize {\n        self.shared_value\n    }\n}\n\n// ...\n\nfn main() {\n    let in_waiting_state = Waiting::new();\n    let in_filling_state = in_waiting_state.to_filling();\n}\n\nGosh that's a buncha code! So the idea here was that all states have some common shared values along with their own specialized values. As you can see from the to_filling() function we can consume a given 'Waiting' state and transition it into a 'Filling' state. Let's do a little rundown:\n\nTransition errors are caught at compile time! For example you can't even create a Filling state accidentally without first starting with a Waiting state. (You could on purpose, but this is beside the matter.)\nTransition enforcement happens everywhere.\nWhen a transition between states is made the old value is consumed instead of just modified. We could have done this with the enum example above as well though.\nWe don't have to match all the time.\nMemory consumption is still lean, at any given time the size is that of the state.\n\nThere are some downsides though:\n\nThere is a bunch of code repetition. You have to implement the same functions and traits for multiple structures.\nIt's not always clear what values are shared between all states and just one. Updating code later could be a pain due to this.\nSince the size of the state is variable we end up needing to wrap this in an enum as above for it to be usable where the state machine is simply one component of a more complex system. Here's what this could look like:\n\nenum State {\n    Waiting(Waiting),\n    Filling(Filling),\n    Done(Done),\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let in_waiting_state = State::Waiting(Waiting::new());\n    // This doesn't work since the `Waiting` struct is wrapped! We need to `match` to get it out.\n    let in_filling_state = State::Filling(in_waiting_state.to_filling());\n}\n\nAs you can see, this isn't very ergonomic. We're getting closer to what we want though. The idea of moving between distinct types seems to be a good way forward! Before we go try something entirely different though, let's talk about a simple way to change our example that could enlighten further thinking.\nThe Rust standard library defines two highly related traits: From and Into that are extremely useful and worth checking out. An important thing to note is that implementing one of these automatically implements the other. In general implementing From is preferable as it's a bit more flexible. We can implement them very easily for our above example like so:\n// ...\nimpl From&lt;Waiting&gt; for Filling {\n    fn from(val: Waiting) -&gt; Filling {\n        Filling {\n            rate: 1,\n            shared_value: val.shared_value,\n        }\n    }\n}\n// ...\n\nNot only does this give us a common function for transitioning, but it also is nice to read about in the source code! This reduces mental burden on us and makes it easier for readers to comprehend. Instead of implementing custom functions we're just using a pattern already existing. Building our pattern on top of already existing patterns is a great way forward.\nSo this is cool, but how do we deal with all this nasty code repetition and the repeating shared_value stuff? Let's explore a bit more!\nGenerically Sophistication\nIn this adventure we'll combine lessons and ideas from the first two, along with a few new ideas, to get something more satisfying. The core of this is to harness the power of generics. Let's take a look at a fairly bare structure representing this:\nstruct BottleFillingMachine&lt;S&gt; {\n    shared_value: usize,\n    state: S\n}\n\n// The following states can be the 'S' in StateMachine&lt;S&gt;\n\nstruct Waiting {\n    waiting_time: std::time::Duration,\n}\n\nstruct Filling {\n    rate: usize,\n}\n\nstruct Done;\n\nSo here we're actually building the state into the type signature of the BottleFillingMachine itself. A state machine in the 'Filling' state is BottleFillingMachine&lt;Filling&gt; which is just awesome since it means when we see it as part of an error message or something we know immediately what state the machine is in.\nFrom there we can go ahead and implement From&lt;T&gt; for some of these specific generic variants like so:\nimpl From&lt;BottleFillingMachine&lt;Waiting&gt;&gt; for BottleFillingMachine&lt;Filling&gt; {\n    fn from(val: BottleFillingMachine&lt;Waiting&gt;) -&gt; BottleFillingMachine&lt;Filling&gt; {\n        BottleFillingMachine {\n            shared_value: val.shared_value,\n            state: Filling {\n                rate: 1,\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl From&lt;BottleFillingMachine&lt;Filling&gt;&gt; for BottleFillingMachine&lt;Done&gt; {\n    fn from(val: BottleFillingMachine&lt;Filling&gt;) -&gt; BottleFillingMachine&lt;Done&gt; {\n        BottleFillingMachine {\n            shared_value: val.shared_value,\n            state: Done,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nDefining a starting state for the machine looks like this:\nimpl BottleFillingMachine&lt;Waiting&gt; {\n    fn new(shared_value: usize) -&gt; Self {\n        BottleFillingMachine {\n            shared_value: shared_value,\n            state: Waiting {\n                waiting_time: std::time::Duration::new(0, 0),\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSo how does it look to change between two states? Like this:\nfn main() {\n    let in_waiting = BottleFillingMachine::&lt;Waiting&gt;::new(0);\n    let in_filling = BottleFillingMachine::&lt;Filling&gt;::from(in_waiting);\n}\n\nAlternatively if you're doing this inside of a function whose type signature restricts the possible outputs it might look like this:\nfn transition_the_states(val: BottleFillingMachine&lt;Waiting&gt;) -&gt; BottleFillingMachine&lt;Filling&gt; {\n    val.into() // Nice right?\n}\n\nWhat do the compile time error messages look like?\nerror[E0277]: the trait bound `BottleFillingMachine&lt;Done&gt;: std::convert::From&lt;BottleFillingMachine&lt;Waiting&gt;&gt;` is not satisfied\n  --&gt; &lt;anon&gt;:50:22\n   |\n50 |     let in_filling = BottleFillingMachine::&lt;Done&gt;::from(in_waiting);\n   |                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n   |\n   = help: the following implementations were found:\n   = help:   &lt;BottleFillingMachine&lt;Filling&gt; as std::convert::From&lt;BottleFillingMachine&lt;Waiting&gt;&gt;&gt;\n   = help:   &lt;BottleFillingMachine&lt;Done&gt; as std::convert::From&lt;BottleFillingMachine&lt;Filling&gt;&gt;&gt;\n   = note: required by `std::convert::From::from`\n\nIt's pretty clear what's wrong from that. The error message even hints to us some valid transitions!\nSo what does this scheme give us?\n\nTransitions are ensured to be valid at compile time.\nThe error messages about invalid transitions are very understandable and even list valid options.\nWe have a 'parent' structure which can have traits and values associated with it that aren't repeated.\nOnce a transition is made the old state no longer exists, it is consumed. Indeed, the entire structure is consumed so if there are side effects of the transition on the parent (for example altering the average waiting time) we can't access stale values.\nMemory consumption is lean and everything is on the stack.\n\nThere are some downsides still:\n\nOur From&lt;T&gt; implementations suffer from a fair bit of \"type noise\". This is a highly minor concern though.\nEach BottleFillingMachine&lt;S&gt; has a different size, with our previous example, so we'll need to use an enum. Because of our structure though we can do this in a way that doesn't completely suck.\n\n\nYou can play with this example here\n\nGetting Messy With the Parents\nSo how can we have some parent structure hold our state machine without it being a gigantic pain to interact with? Well, this circles us back around to the enum idea we had at first.\nIf you recall the primary problem with the enum example above was that we had to deal with no ability to enforce transitions, and the only errors we got were at runtime when we did try.\nenum BottleFillingMachineWrapper {\n    Waiting(BottleFillingMachine&lt;Waiting&gt;),\n    Filling(BottleFillingMachine&lt;Filling&gt;),\n    Done(BottleFillingMachine&lt;Done&gt;),\n}\nstruct Factory {\n    bottle_filling_machine: BottleFillingMachineWrapper,\n}\nimpl Factory {\n    fn new() -&gt; Self {\n        Factory {\n            bottle_filling_machine: BottleFillingMachineWrapper::Waiting(BottleFillingMachine::new(0)),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAt this point your first reaction is likely \"Gosh, Hoverbear, look at that awful and long type signature!\" You're quite right! Frankly it's rather long, but I picked long, explanatory type names! You'll be able to use all your favorite arcane abbreviations and type aliases in your own code. Have at!\nimpl BottleFillingMachineWrapper {\n    fn step(mut self) -&gt; Self {\n        match self {\n            BottleFillingMachineWrapper::Waiting(val) =&gt; BottleFillingMachineWrapper::Filling(val.into()),\n            BottleFillingMachineWrapper::Filling(val) =&gt; BottleFillingMachineWrapper::Done(val.into()),\n            BottleFillingMachineWrapper::Done(val) =&gt; BottleFillingMachineWrapper::Waiting(val.into()),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut the_factory = Factory::new();\n    the_factory.bottle_filling_machine = the_factory.bottle_filling_machine.step();\n}\n\nAgain you may notice that this works by consumption not mutation. Using match the way we are above moves val so that it can be used with .into() which we've already determined should consume the state. If you'd really like to use mutation you can consider having your states #[derive(Clone)] or even Copy, but that's your call.\nDespite this being a bit less ergonomic and pleasant to work with than we might want we still get strongly enforced state transitions and all the guarantees that come with them.\nOne thing you will notice is this scheme does force you to handle all potential states when manipulating the machine, and that makes sense. You are reaching into a structure with a state machine and manipulating it, you need to have defined actions for each state that it is in.\nOr you can just panic!() if that's what you really want. But if you just wanted to panic!() then why didn't you just use the first attempt?\n\nYou can see a fully worked example of this Factory example here\n\nWorked Examples\nThis is the kind of thing it's always nice to have some examples for. So below I've put together a couple worked examples with comments for you to explore.\nThree State, Two Transitions\nThis example is very similar to the Bottle Filling Machine above, but instead it actually does work, albeit trivial work. It takes a string and returns the number of words in it.\n\nPlayground link\n\nfn main() {\n    // The `&lt;StateA&gt;` is implied here. We don't need to add type annotations!\n    let in_state_a = StateMachine::new(\"Blah blah blah\".into());\n\n    // This is okay here. But later once we've changed state it won't work anymore.\n    in_state_a.some_unrelated_value;\n    println!(\"Starting Value: {}\", in_state_a.state.start_value);\n\n\n    // Transition to the new state. This consumes the old state.\n    // Here we need type annotations (since not all StateMachines are linear in their state).\n    let in_state_b = StateMachine::&lt;StateB&gt;::from(in_state_a);\n\n    // This doesn't work! The value is moved when we transition!\n    // in_state_a.some_unrelated_value;\n    // Instead, we can use the existing value.\n    in_state_b.some_unrelated_value;\n\n    println!(\"Interm Value: {:?}\", in_state_b.state.interm_value);\n\n    // And our final state.\n    let in_state_c = StateMachine::&lt;StateC&gt;::from(in_state_b);\n\n    // This doesn't work either! The state doesn't even contain this value.\n    // in_state_c.state.start_value;\n\n    println!(\"Final state: {}\", in_state_c.state.final_value);\n}\n\n// Here is our pretty state machine.\nstruct StateMachine&lt;S&gt; {\n    some_unrelated_value: usize,\n    state: S,\n}\n\n// It starts, predictably, in `StateA`\nimpl StateMachine&lt;StateA&gt; {\n    fn new(val: String) -&gt; Self {\n        StateMachine {\n            some_unrelated_value: 0,\n            state: StateA::new(val)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// State A starts the machine with a string.\nstruct StateA {\n    start_value: String,\n}\nimpl StateA {\n    fn new(start_value: String) -&gt; Self {\n        StateA {\n            start_value: start_value,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// State B goes and breaks up that String into words.\nstruct StateB {\n    interm_value: Vec&lt;String&gt;,\n}\nimpl From&lt;StateMachine&lt;StateA&gt;&gt; for StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt; {\n    fn from(val: StateMachine&lt;StateA&gt;) -&gt; StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt; {\n        StateMachine {\n            some_unrelated_value: val.some_unrelated_value,\n            state: StateB {\n                interm_value: val.state.start_value.split(\" \").map(|x| x.into()).collect(),\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Finally, StateC gives us the length of the vector, or the word count.\nstruct StateC {\n    final_value: usize,\n}\nimpl From&lt;StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt;&gt; for StateMachine&lt;StateC&gt; {\n    fn from(val: StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt;) -&gt; StateMachine&lt;StateC&gt; {\n        StateMachine {\n            some_unrelated_value: val.some_unrelated_value,\n            state: StateC {\n                final_value: val.state.interm_value.len(),\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nA Raft Example\nIf you've followed my posts for awhile you may know I rather enjoy thinking about Raft. Raft, and a discussion with @argorak were the primary motivators behind all of this research.\nRaft is a bit more complex than the above examples as it does not just have linear states where A-&gt;B-&gt;C. Here is the transition diagram:\n++++++++++-+    ++++++++++--+    +++++++--+\n|          ++++-&gt;           |    |        |\n| Follower |    | Candidate ++++-&gt; Leader |\n|          &lt;+++-+           |    |        |\n+++++++--^-+    ++++++++++--+    +-++++++++\n         |                         |\n         +++++++++++++++++++++++++-+\n\n\nPlayground link\n\n// You can play around in this function.\nfn main() {\n    let is_follower = Raft::new(/* ... */);\n    // Raft typically comes in groups of 3, 5, or 7. Just 1 for us. :)\n\n    // Simulate this node timing out first.\n    let is_candidate = Raft::&lt;Candidate&gt;::from(is_follower);\n\n    // It wins! How unexpected.\n    let is_leader = Raft::&lt;Leader&gt;::from(is_candidate);\n\n    // Then it fails and rejoins later, becoming a Follower again.\n    let is_follower_again = Raft::&lt;Follower&gt;::from(is_leader);\n\n    // And goes up for election...\n    let is_candidate_again = Raft::&lt;Candidate&gt;::from(is_follower_again);\n\n    // But this time it fails!\n    let is_follower_another_time = Raft::&lt;Follower&gt;::from(is_candidate_again);\n}\n\n\n// This is our state machine.\nstruct Raft&lt;S&gt; {\n    // ... Shared Values\n    state: S\n}\n\n// The three cluster states a Raft node can be in\n\n// If the node is the Leader of the cluster services requests and replicates its state.\nstruct Leader {\n    // ... Specific State Values\n}\n\n// If it is a Candidate it is attempting to become a leader due to timeout or initialization.\nstruct Candidate {\n    // ... Specific State Values\n}\n\n// Otherwise the node is a follower and is replicating state it receives.\nstruct Follower {\n    // ... Specific State Values\n}\n\n// Raft starts in the Follower state\nimpl Raft&lt;Follower&gt; {\n    fn new(/* ... */) -&gt; Self {\n        // ...\n        Raft {\n            // ...\n            state: Follower { /* ... */ }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// The following are the defined transitions between states.\n\n// When a follower timeout triggers it begins to campaign\nimpl From&lt;Raft&lt;Follower&gt;&gt; for Raft&lt;Candidate&gt; {\n    fn from(val: Raft&lt;Follower&gt;) -&gt; Raft&lt;Candidate&gt; {\n        // ... Logic prior to transition\n        Raft {\n            // ... attr: val.attr\n            state: Candidate { /* ... */ }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// If it doesn't receive a majority of votes it loses and becomes a follower again.\nimpl From&lt;Raft&lt;Candidate&gt;&gt; for Raft&lt;Follower&gt; {\n    fn from(val: Raft&lt;Candidate&gt;) -&gt; Raft&lt;Follower&gt; {\n        // ...

Logic prior to transition\n        Raft {\n            // ... attr: val.attr\n            state: Follower { /* ... */ }\n        }\n    }\n}\nAlternatives From Feedback\nI saw an interesting comment by I-impv on Reddit showing off this approach based on our examples above. Here's what they had to say about it:\n\nI like the way you did it. I am working on a fairly complex FSM myself currently and did it slightly different.\nSome things I did different:\n\nI also modeled the input for the state machine. That way you can model your transitions as a match over (State, Event) every invalid combination is handled by the 'default' pattern\nInstead of using panic for invalid transitions I used a Failure state, So every invalid combination transitions to that Failure state\n\n\nI really like the idea of modeling the input in the transitions!\nClosing Thoughts\nRust lets us represent State Machines in a fairly good way. In an ideal situation we'd be able to make enums with restricted transitions between variants, but that's not the case. Instead, we can harness the power of generics and the ownership system to create something expressive, safe, and understandable.\nIf you have any feedback or suggestions on this article I'd suggest checking out the footer of this page for contact details. I also hang out on Mozilla's IRC as Hoverbear.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/rust-state-machine-pattern/","title":"Pretty State Machine Patterns in Rust"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/rust-travis-github-pages/":{"body":"Rust is probably my favorite programming language (as the contents of this site suggests). My interests in networks, development operations, and systems programming align strongly with Rust. They're pursuing the trifecta: Safe, Fast, Concurrent. It's been a great learning journey for me so far and I learnt to write better code in all languages.\nGithub Pages is Github's very generous offering of web hosting to your projects. Basically, you create a branch gh-pages and push it to Github, then browse to https://$USERNAME.github.io/$REPOSITORY.\n\nTravisCI offers free continuous integration for open-source projects. It's even integrated with rust-ci. I've had a great experience with the service. They're also the source of the little build status buttons like this one .\nToday, we'll talk about how to set up your very own Rust project to:\n\nAutomagically build and test your project.\nOn a successful test push a new version of your documentation onto a gh-pages branch, as provided by rustdoc.\n\nMaking a Demo Project\nLet's make a demo repository to play.\ncargo new travis-demo\ncd travis-demo\n\nFor simplicity, we'll replace the contents of src/lib.rs with the following:\n#![crate_name = \"travis-demo\"]\n#![crate_type = \"lib\"]\n\n//! This is a comment.\n\n/// This function always returns true. It's very useful!\npub fn always_true() -&gt; bool { true }\n\n#[test]\nfn it_works() {\n    assert_eq!(always_true(), true);\n}\n\n\nIf you haven't had a chance to learn about rustdoc you can read about it here.\n\nNow you can run cargo doc and visit a url like file:///Users/hoverbear/travis-demo/target/doc/travis-demo/ to view the generated documentation.\n\n        Our Documentation\n        \n    \nFinally, push this project up to Github (You'll need to make it on Github!):\ngit add Cargo.toml src .gitignore\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit.\"\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:Hoverbear/travis-demo.git\ngit push -u origin master\nStarting with Travis\nFirst, you'll need to sign up with Travis. This is trivially done by visiting TravisCI and signing in with Github.\nThen, visit your profile by clicking on your name in the top right corner.\n\n        How to get to your profile.\n        \n    \nOn this page, in the \"Repositories\" tab, you'll see a list of all your public repositories. If you just made your repository you might need to tell Travis to Sync Now.\n\nTravis has a .com for your private repositories.\n\nNow enable our demo repository by flipping the switch.\nFeel encouraged to take a moment to click on the wrench and explore the options Travis offers. We'll play with them in a minute!\nSet up your Repository\n\nKMC offers us a more secure approach for users who do not wish to permit Travis to push to their repositories.\n\nTravis uses a .travis.yml to configure how it works. You can read more about it here.\nWe can add the following to ours:\nlanguage: rust\nafter_success: |\n  [ $TRAVIS_BRANCH = master ] &amp;&amp;\n  [ $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST = false ] &amp;&amp;\n  cargo doc &amp;&amp;\n  echo \"&lt;meta http-equiv=refresh content=0;url=`echo $TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG | cut -d '/' -f 2`/index.html&gt;\" &gt; target/doc/index.html &amp;&amp;\n  sudo pip install ghp-import &amp;&amp;\n  ghp-import -n target/doc &amp;&amp;\n  git push -fq https://${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/${TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG}.git gh-pages\n\nlanguage: lets us specify rust, which for now defaults to the latest nightly.\nafter_success: lets us declare a script to run after a successful build. I found this series of steps somewhere, modified them a bit, and they work fantastic. The script basically does the following:\n\nIf it's not a push to master finish.\nOtherwise, run cargo doc\nMake a redirect in the index.html to the proper location. (This assumes your repository name is the same as your crate, feel free to change it.)\nPushes the new copy of documentation to Github using a secure token. (More on that in a second.)\n\nBut wait! Where do we get the Token?\nGiving Travis Permissions\nSince it would be positively outrageous to give Travis your Github password or private key, we'll use what's called an \"access token\". To get one of these, go to your Github settings and hit the \"Applictions\" tab.\n\n        Getting a token\n        \n    \n\n        Token Creation Screen\n        \n    \nOnce you hit \"Generate Token\" you'll return to the previous page and see a green highlighted key. Copy that, you won't see it again!\nNow, install the Travis Gem. Then you need to authenticate using travis login using your Github credentials.\nOnce Travis is installed and logged in, you can run this, where $YOUR_TOKEN is the one we copied earlier.\ntravis encrypt GH_TOKEN=$YOUR_TOKEN --add env.global\n\nThis command should automatically add a few lines to your .travis.yml.\n\nWhy encrypt? Because it's probably a bad idea to store an access token for your Github account in the clear.\n\ngit add .travis.yml\ngit commit -m \"Add Travis\"\ngit push\n\nNow if you visit https://travis-ci.org/repositories you should, eventually, see your build pop up! Note that Travis can take a moment to start a build.\nYour build should look similar to the following:\n\n        Example Build\n        \n    \nTinkering with the Crate\nUnfortunately, the first build of a gh-pages branch can take awhile to become available. So just relax, and lets tinker with things a bit.\nLet's go back to your src/lib.rs and add a couple more declarations.\nTo set a base URL you can add this:\n#![doc(html_root_url = \"https://hoverbear.github.io/travis-demo/\")]\n\nTo set an image for the documentation you can add an image to your Github repository and do something like the following:\n#![doc(html_logo_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hoverbear/travis-demo/master/demo.png\")]\n\nOnce you change those, commit them, push it to origin master, and visit Travis again. You can see Travis will take the new revision and test it as well. (You can see there is even a \"Build Log\") Once the test succeeds you'll see, again, how it builds docs and sets them up.\n\nIf you create a pull request or branch, you'll notice that the Travis builds don't push new documentation except to commits on master.\n\nTinkering with Travis\nTravis offers us some great options for configuring our output during tests.\nThe first is RUST_BACKTRACE, we can set it to 1 to make Rust print out a stacktrace on a panic. This is particularly useful combined with panic!(), unreachable!() and unimplemented!() which you can use to structure failure modes in your programs.\nIf you use log and env-logger you also might want to set RUST_LOG. I would definitely suggest limiting the logging to a specific crate as otherwise rustc and other libs will spout a considerable amount of output.\n\n        Setting ENV Variables\n        \n    \nA While Later...\nTry visiting https://$YOUR_GITHUB_USER.github.io/$YOUR_REPO. Did it work? Awesome!\nDon't forget to add it to the repository page on Github!\n\n        Our new Repo\n        \n    \nEnjoy your new documentation! Your users will appreciate your documentation being up to date, you don't need to do it yourself, and later on you can hack this method to only handle commits to stable or other tags.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/rust-travis-github-pages/","title":"Rust, Travis, and Github Pages"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/setting-up-a-rust-devenv/":{"body":"In this post we'll be discussing one way to set up your machine for Rust development. There are different ways, particularly related to the text editor, so feel free to skip what is irrelevant to you. We'll focus on:\n\nSetting up Rust via Rustup.\nValuable tools like clippy and rustfmt.\nConfiguring VS Code for Rust.\nDebugging with the command line and inside of VS Code.\nUsing different compile targets.\n\nEverything we do should be functional on both Linux and MacOS, on Windows your mileage may vary. I, unfortunately, don't have a Windows instance to test on.\n\nIn order to finish this all up you'll need to have the build-essentials (Ubuntu/Debian), base-devel (Arch), or XCode (Mac) installed already.\nSetting up Rust via Rustup\nRustup is an official Rust project that allows us to install, manage, and update multiple Rust toolchains. It can be installed easily via:\ncurl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\n\nAfter a brief download Rustup will prompt us for some configuration. Just accept the defaults here:\nCurrent installation options:\n\n   default host triple: x86_64-apple-darwin\n     default toolchain: stable\n  modify PATH variable: yes\n\n1) Proceed with installation (default)\n2) Customize installation\n3) Cancel installation\n\nAfter we'll be prompted to run the following command to update the current shell with the changes:\nsource $HOME/.cargo/env\n\nAt this point we can run cargo and rustc to confirm that we have Rust and Cargo installed. Also confirm that rustup exists since we'll need that later.\nNext it's advisable to install the Rust source and documentation locally for later use when offline or for tools such as the autocompletion we set up later.\nrustup component add rust-src\nrustup component add rust-docs\n\nEventually we'll want to update our Rust installation, the following command will update all toolchains and components.\nrustup update\n\nEventually you may encounter a project which prefers to use Rust's nightly builds. You can easily install the nightly (or beta) version alongside stable.\nrustup toolchain install nightly\n\nYou can change the default toolchain of the system with rustup default stable or rustup default nightly, but it's advisable to keep it to stable and set overrides for projects that use nightly. You can do that by navigating to the project directory and running the following:\nrustup override set nightly\n\nFor now that's all we need to know about Rustup, so let's move on.\nValuable Tools\nWe'll cover four valuable tools for working with Rust:\n\nrust-clippy - A linter.\nrustfmt - A code formatter.\nracer - An autocompletion utility.\nrls - A language server (for symbol search etc.)\n\nrust-clippy\nWhy do we want this? The Rust compiler is already quite strict, clippy goes a step further and helps prevent some things which are valid but bad practice. This can help prevent unexpected problems later in your code.\nclippy requires nightly in order to run. Earlier we installed nightly alongside stable with rustup toolchain install nightly, so we can use it without any issues.\nWe'll need to use nightly to install it, so we just need to run the following:\ncargo +nightly install clippy\n\nNow let's create a test case. Run cargo init --bin test &amp;&amp; cd test then modify the src/main.rs file to have to have the following:\nfn main() {\n    // Clippy warns on statements with no effect, like this one.\n    true;\n}\n\nNow we can run clippy with the following command:\ncargo +nightly clippy\n\nThis should yield a warning from clippy:\nwarning = \"statement with no effect\"\n --&gt; src/main.rs:2:5\n  |\n2 |     true;\n  |     ^^^^^\n  |\n  = note: #[warn(no_effect)] on by default\n  = help: for further information visit https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/wiki#no_effect\n\nExcellent. You can see the different lints which clippy detects here. You can configure various lints in the clippy.toml according to their options listed in the wiki.\nTo disable (or warn instead of deny) various lints you can add the deny and allow flags to your crate attributes:\n#![cfg_attr(feature = \"cargo-clippy\", deny(empty_enum))]\n#![cfg_attr(feature = \"cargo-clippy\", warn(indexing_slicing))]\n#![cfg_attr(feature = \"cargo-clippy\", allow(print_with_newline))]\nrustfmt\nWhy do we want this? Having consistent, standard automated styling in a project (and across many projects) can be useful for code review, attracting new contributors, and avoiding unproductive discussions.\nrustfmt is a code formatting tool akin to gofmt. Unlike clippy, it runs happily on stable. To install it:\ncargo install rustfmt\n\nAt this point we can run cargo fmt to format a repository. It runs rustfmt in the 'replace' mode which creates backup files with a .bk extension. If our project is already in version control we may not want this. If that is the case we can edit rustfmt.toml to include the following:\nwrite_mode = \"overwrite\"\n\nThe rustfmt.toml lets us configure the various options found in rustfmt --config-help. Now let's edit the main.rs we made later to have some obviously poor style:\nfn       main    ()\n{ true\n; }\n\nThen we can run cargo fmt and we can see that our file is correctly formatted again.\nGotcha: rustfmt is still not in perfect shape and will occasionally butcher the formatting of otherwise normal looking code. Your mileage may vary for the time being.\nracer\nWhy do we want this? It saves us some time looking through documentation and helps us discover functionality as we type.\nracer is a code completion utility that's used in various editor addons and with rls which we'll set up next. Earlier we ran rustup component add rust-src which is important for racer.\nFirst, install it:\ncargo install racer\n\nNext we need to set an environment variable so racer knows where to look for the Rust source. In your ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc etc) add the following line:\n# Mac\nexport RUST_SRC_PATH=${HOME}/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/src/rust/src\n# Linux\nexport RUST_SRC_PATH=${HOME}/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src/rust/src\n\nIf you're not on MacOS or Linux you will need to set this to what is shown as default in rustup show.\nThen you can test that racer works by doing a test run via the command line:\nracer complete std::io::B\n\nYou should see several matches from this. At this point racer is set up and ready to be used in your editor or with rls.\nrls\nWhy do we want this? It enables a much richer development experience and extends on the capabilities of racer.\nrls is a language server implementation for Rust. It provides things like code completion, goto definitions, rich refactoring, and some other nice features.\nTo install rls we need to use Rustup, specifying the appropriate toolchain when we do. (Macs use nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin, Linux should be nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu) If you don't use VS Code it might be worth skipping this step for now.\nrustup component add rls --toolchain nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin\nrustup component add rust-analysis --toolchain nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin\nrustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin\n\nNext we need to set up an environment variable. We need to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and RLS_ROOT (you'll probably need to adjust this to your repository clone):\n# Mac\nexport DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-apple-darwin/lib\nexport RLS_ROOT=${HOME}/git/rust/rls\n# Linux\nexport DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib\nexport RLS_ROOT=${HOME}/git/rust/rls\n\nAt this point it should be set up. We'll test and use it later when we configure VS Code.\nConfiguring VS Code for Rust\nI've been using VS Code for Rust for several months and it's quite pleasant. As with any text editor there are many knobs to tweak, so we're just going to focus on the directly relevant ones.\n\nYou may use a different editor, and that's totally fine. Have at! I still regularly reach for vim for minor edits and some of my colleagues quite enjoy their emacs. Diversity is good, use what is best for you and let others use what is best for them.\n\nFirst, let's download VS Code. Drop over to their website and grab the installer. I'm a bit silly and use the 'Insiders' version that is released nightly, but you don't need to.\nIn order to run code from the command line we may need to open up VS Code and open the 'Command Palette' with Shift+Command+P on Mac, or Shift+Control+P on Linux. In it, enter shell command and look for the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH option. After doing this any new shell we open should be able to run code.\nExtension: Rust\nThe 'Rust' extension provides some helpers around build, formatting, and other useful things. It can be installed by selecting the bottom 'Box with border and smaller box in the top right corner' button on the sidebar and searching for 'Rust'. You can take a look at the readme before you install.\nExtension: rls_vscode\nWe'll need node installed, you can do this via your package manager (If you're on a Mac brew works great.)\nOnce this is done we can install the rls_vscode extension. Since rls isn't released yet we need to do all the fun work ourselves! Nagivate to your regular git directory and clone the repository and install its dependencies.\ngit clone https://github.com/jonathandturner/rls_vscode.git\ncd rls_vscode\nnpm install\n\nNext step is to build the extension, which we do through VS Code itself. Run code . in the repository we just cloned. In the VS Code window, select the 'Crossed out bug' icon and hit the green 'Play Button' beside the words 'Launch Extension' in the left. A new VS Code window will pop up, you can just close it.\nNow that the extension is built we can set up a symlink to install it into VS Code (if you're using Insiders the directory is .vscode-insiders):\nln -s ${HOME}/git/rust/rls_vscode/ ${HOME}/.vscode/extensions/rls_vscode\n\nLater you can update the extension with a similar process. Due to the development pace it's advisable do to this every once in awhile.\nNext, quit VS Code and reopen it. Open up any Rust project and you should see in the blue bar at the bottom \"RLS analysis: Starting up\", this should change to \"RLS analysis: Done\" shortly after.\nGotcha: If you reboot your machine you will need to open a terminal before opening VS Code, or use the integrated terminal in VS Code and restart it, before RLS will be able to successfully start. There are some ways around this but they're rather annoying in their own right. Perhaps in the future there will be a setting in VS Code.\nExtension: Better TOML\nThe Rust ecosystem frequently uses TOML files for configuration. While 'Rusty code' provides basic TOML support, the 'Better TOML' goes a bit further, and is worth installing as well.\nExtension: LLDB Debugger\nThe 'LLDB Debugger' (that's 'Low Level Debugger Debugger' for those paying attention) extension later if we want to debug our Rust applications from inside VS Code. It can be installed from the Extensions tab. You'll also need Python's six library which you can install via pip install six.\nWe'll talk about how to use this extension in the next section.\nDebugging Rust Code\nLet's scaffold out a super basic application to test our debugging on before we get on to any real experimentation. We'll run cargo init --bin example and set src/main.rs to:\npub enum Direction { North, South, East, West }\n\npub fn is_north(dir: Direction) -&gt; bool {\n    match dir {\n        Direction::North =&gt; true,\n        _ =&gt; false,\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let two = 1+1;\n    println!(\"{}\", two);\n\n    let points = Direction::South;\n    let compass = is_north(points);\n    println!(\"{}\", compass);\n}\n\nThis gives us something actually worthwhile to use the debugger on. Let's debug!\nOn The Command Line\nThe first step before debugging is to build, then fire it up with the debugger:\ncargo build\nrust-lldb ./target/debug/example\n\nFrom here we can interact with the program like we normally would with LLDB. (Yes, there is rust-gdb, you're free to use that too!)\nFor example:\n(lldb) breakpoint set -f main.rs -l 3\nBreakpoint 1: where = example`example::is_north + 10 at main.rs:3, address = 0x0000000100000ffa\n(lldb) process launch\nProcess 8376 launched: '/Users/hoverbear/git/rust/example/target/debug/example' (x86_64)\n2\nProcess 8376 stopped\n* thread #1: tid = 0x2c222, 0x0000000100000ffa example`example::is_north(dir=South) + 10 at main.rs:3, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1\n    frame #0: 0x0000000100000ffa example`example::is_north(dir=South) + 10 at main.rs:3\n   1   \tpub enum Direction { North, South, East, West }\n   2\n-&gt; 3   \tfn is_north(dir: Direction) -&gt; bool {\n   4   \t    match dir {\n   5   \t        Direction::North =&gt; true,\n   6   \t        _ =&gt; false,\n   7   \t    }\n(lldb) print dir\n(example::Direction) $0 = South\nWith VS Code\nAfter installing the 'LLDB Debugger' extension you can set a breakpoint by clicking to the left of the line numbers, you'll see a big red dot marking a breakpoint. In order to actually debug we need to do a couple things:\nAdd the following to .vscode/launch.json:\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"lldb\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"name\": \"Debug\",\n            \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/target/debug/example\",\n            \"args\": [],\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\n            \"preLaunchTask\": \"cargo\",\n            \"sourceLanguages\": [\"rust\"]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nThen, add a .vscode/tasks.json with the following:\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"command\": \"cargo\",\n    \"isShellCommand\": true,\n    \"args\": [\"build\"],\n    \"showOutput\": \"always\"\n}\n\nNext let's set a breakpoint somewhere. Finally we can go to the 'No Bugs' icon and hit the 'Play' and we should see something like this:\n\n        Demonstrating the VS Debugger\n        \n    \nCompiling to Different Targets\nSo far we've been building x86_64-apple-darwin. If we were using Linux we'd be building x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu most likely. Let's target asmjs-unknown-emscripten (that is, Javascript) for fun.\nFirst we need to install the emcripten package. On Mac this can be found in brew via brew install emscripten, some Linux distributions also package emscripten, but you can also set it up via the guide here.\nNext install the target with rustup:\nrustup target add asmjs-unknown-emscripten\n\nIf on Mac, the following probably needs to be changed in ~/.emscripten:\nLLVM_ROOT = \"/usr/local/opt/emscripten/libexec/llvm/bin\"\n#LLVM_ROOT = os.path.expanduser(os.getenv('LLVM') or '/usr/bin') # directory\n#BINARYEN_ROOT = os.path.expanduser(os.getenv('BINARYEN') or '/usr/bin') # directory\n\n# Avoid annoying popups about Java.\n#JAVA = 'java'\n\nNow you can compile our example in asm.js, then run it:\ncargo build --target=asmjs-unknown-emscripten\nnode target/asmjs-unknown-emscripten/debug/example.js\n\nThe output should be:\n2\nfalse\n\nTargetting other systems and architectures works similarly, the biggest stumbling block is installing the toolchain (in this case it was emscripten.)\nClosing Thoughts\nAt this point we have a functional Rust development environment that can target our native system as well as asm.js. Our editor supports debugging and has nice features like autocomplete. Finally, we have handy tools like clippy to help us detect errors.\nSome of the tools and extensions we're using are still alpha, or don't work perhaps as well as we might hope, but things are only getting better! If you're interested, you can even get involved with these different projects to help them be even more awesome. Every few weeks you can go and do a quick update of things and see the improvements.\nNow, we don't have any excuses not to have fun with Rust! Why not find something that looks interesting and try to make your first PR? Can't find something? Check out /r/rust and look at the projects people are talking about, look at the E - Easy issues on rustc, or tackle something small from rust-rosetta!\n\nThanks to Asquera for allocating some time for me to write this!

Great, fantastic! Clojure is a lisp that runs on the JVM, the CLR, and compiles to Javascript. Lets get started!\nSome links we'll need:\n\nImmutant - The framework.\nClojure - The language.\nLeiningen - The package manager.\n\nGetting Leiningen\nAssuming ~/bin/ is a folder in your $PATH\nDEST=~/bin/lein\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein &gt; $DEST\nchmod +x $DEST\nGetting Clojure\nYou get Clojure (oddly) through lein. Just run it, and it'll download everything it needs.\nlein\n\nThat was easy!\nSetting up an Immutant Project\nThis is a lightly expanded version of this page.\nUse lein to initialize a new project.\nlein new app learning\ncd learning\n\nThe folder learning/ should have a file project.clj which you should edit to look like this:\n(defproject learning \"0.1.0-SNAPSHOT\"\n  :description \"FIXME: write description\"\n  :url \"http://example.com/FIXME\"\n  :license {:name \"MPL\"\n            :url \"http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mpl-2.0/\"}\n  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure \"1.6.0\"]\n                 [org.immutant/immutant \"2.x.incremental.186\"]]\n  :repositories [[\"Immutant incremental builds\"\n                  \"http://downloads.immutant.org/incremental/\"]]\n  :main ^:skip-aot learning.core\n  :target-path \"target/%s\"\n  :profiles {:uberjar {:aot :all}})\n\nNote how the dependencies and repositories now contain references to immutant. You should change 186 to the latest incremental build at this page.\nThe project.clj file is similar to a package.json in Node.js or Cargo.toml in Rust.\nYour First Route\nThis is a lightly expanded version of this page.\nIn order to have a route (and thus a real web server) you need to add a require for immutant to your src/learning/core.clj. Then, define the app function like so and use run to start it:\n(ns learning.core\n  (:use compojure.core)\n  (:require [compojure.route :as route]\n             [immutant.web :as immutant])\n  (:gen-class))\n\n(defn app [request]\n  \"A basic route for learning.\"\n  {:status 200\n   :body \"Hello world!\"})\n\n(defn -main\n  \"Start the server.\"\n  [&amp; args]\n  (immutant/run app {:host \"localhost\" :port 8080 :path \"/\"}))\n\nTo start the server with lein run in the folder.\nNow browse to http://localhost:8080 and you should see something like:\nHello world!\nMore Routes\nYou're probably thinking \"Well that's great, an app with one route, how useless.\" You'd be quite right, unless you're implementing Yo or something.\nIf you're reading along the Immutant web tutorial you may have noticed in \"Advanced Usage\" they use multiple run functions to serve multiple routes.\nTo quote:\n\n...actually creates two Undertow web server instances: one serving requests for the hello and howdy handlers on port 8080, and one serving ola responses on port 8081.\n\nNot the most desirable option. Looking back up under \"Common Usage\":\n\nFirst, you'll need a Ring handler. If you generated your app using a template from Compojure, Luminus, Caribou or some other Ring-based library, yours will be associated with the :handler key of your :ring map in your project.clj file.\n\nThat sounds certainly more desirable. Let's use Compojure.\nChange your project.clj:\n:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure \"1.6.0\"]\n               [org.immutant/immutant \"2.x.incremental.186\"]\n               [compojure \"1.1.8\"]]\n\nAnd then extend your source file.\n(ns learning.core\n  (:use compojure.core)\n  (:require [compojure.route :as route]\n             [immutant.web :as immutant])\n  (:gen-class))\n\n\n(defn handler\n  \"Comment\"\n  []\n  \"&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;\")\n\n(defroutes app\n  \"The router.\"\n  (GET \"/\" [] (handler))\n  (route/not-found\n       \"&lt;h1&gt;Page not found&lt;/h1&gt;\"))\n\n(defn -main\n  \"Start the server\"\n  [&amp; args]\n  (immutant/run app {:host \"localhost\" :port 8080 :path \"/\"}))\n\nNow you should have multiple routes.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/starting-with-immutant/","title":"Starting with Immutant"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/the-entanglement-of-purpose-and-success/":{"body":"There are few things I remember more clearly from my post-secondary than this question from professor Rob Hancock:\n\nHow do you define success?\n\nI was as much impacted by the question as I was by how my cohort grappled with the question over the next semester, and beyond. It's a question I've continually faced throughout my whole life.\nIt turns out that success to me is an elusive, ephemeral, amorphous concept. It slips from me fingers as I grasp at it, crumbles away as I try to hold onto it, and escapes me if I become too bold or complacent.\nSuccess doesn't need to some end goal to capstone your life: some glorious retirement in a great mansion, a C-level job title, or your offspring seeking out their own success. Success can be just a step away than what you have right now, a short walk, or a long hike. Sometimes, it's exactly where you are.\nIf success is a destination, then purpose is the way there. Purpose is the wind in the sails of a ship, success is a port of call. Purpose guides your path through weathering storms, treacherous seas, and emotional outbursts. It steers you away from the siren's call of whirlpools and icebergs of burnout, and ushers you aginst the looming void of utter failure.\nHard to define, harder to articulate\nIn 'Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space' (and part of the start of Wanderers), Carl Sagan noted the following (emphasis added):\n\n“For all its material advantages, the sedentary life has left us edgy, unfulfilled. Even after 400 generations in villages and cities, we haven’t forgotten. The open road still softly calls, like a nearly forgotten song of childhood. We invest far-off places with a certain romance. This appeal, I suspect, has been meticulously crafted by natural selection as an essential element in our survival. Long summers, mild winters, rich harvests, plentiful game—none of them lasts forever. It is beyond our powers to predict the future. Catastrophic events have a way of sneaking up on us, of catching us unaware. Your own life, or your band’s, or even your species’ might be owed to a restless few—drawn, by a craving they can hardly articulate or understand, to undiscovered lands and new worlds.\" - Carl Sagan\n\nIn 'Pale Blue Dot' Carl was speaking to space exploration, and I suggest the concept of being \"drawn by a craving they can hardly articulate or understand\" can apply quite broadly.\nI spent much of my life driven by a singular overarching desire that I could hardly understand, and couldn't hope to articulate. I could feel it there, it was a molten core of hope &amp; purpose. To realize my hardly understood goals, I threw myself off cliffs I didn't think I'd survive, climbed walls I thought myself unable to scale, dug into the very depths of my soul, and bathed in fires of proving. I had to wear away the armor I'd built up over my life, test myself, prove myself. To myself.\nOnly then could I find myself deserving of my definition of success. Only then could I understand my purpose. Only then could I articulate what gave my life meaning.\nBut then, one can come to realize another fear: What comes after success? Stagnation? A gradual but inevitable drift towards unhappiness? What happens when life has no further meaning? No ladder to climb?\nHow can we hope to reach success, if it is what we fear? Who must we become to reach this success?\n\n        Photographing oneself in a rainy mirror.&nbsp;- @fabiock_\n        \n    \nAdaptation &amp; Unrest\nCarl (above) follows into quoting this:\n\n“I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas…” - Herman Melville, in Moby Dick\n\nAt the start of 2020 I once again listened to Wanderers shortly after reading The Hedonic Treadmill – Are We Forever Chasing Rainbows? by Seph Fontane Pennock . I ponder the relatedness of the two concepts.\nWhen we find success, and there is no ladder or stairway to climb, we start inventing new ones. Consciously, or not. Good things will, eventually, start to feel less good. New ideas in your mind and new changes in your life will cause your definitions of success to change, and with it, your distance to success.\nMany employees will depart if they stop getting promotions and raises, relationships fall apart as the partners start to take each other for granted, and ventures with early success can experience a long, destitute path of abandonment.\nI experience Hedonic Adaptation often and intensely, it is an inner struggle that wears hard on my heart &amp; mind. I never feel like what I have is enough. It causes me to grow unhappy with the luxuries and priviledges I have, it claws at me to want more.\nFor some time, I tried to ignore it or quell it. It never worked, of course. This trait is part of my very nature: to refuse it life is to refuse myself wholeness.\nThese days, I've been trying to learn to control my adaptation. I'm trying to guide my unrest towards entirely new goals with a social or ecological good. To experience a lust and greed for good outcomes, rather than trying to stop myself from experiencing it all together.\nI am priviledged to witness so many of my peers and mentors devoting their expertise and efforts into community projects like Rust, and non-profits like Natives in Tech,  Trans Lifeline, and RustFest. Perhaps for some, like myself, this helps them define success and follow their purpose outside of their families and professions. Perhaps for them, like myself, this helps them fight against hedonic adaptation.\nTending your flame\nIf one hopes to use the process of seeking success to fuel to keep the fire of purpose, that fire must be tended to carefully.\nUnpredictable chaotic gusts can extinguish a weak flame, improper preparation can cause later failure, the passage of time may bring intense weathering rain or snow, and the consumption of fuel must be balanced.\nIn a wood fire, there are three core elements:\n\nThe air: a chaotic, shapeless mass which must constantly flow (but not too fast, or too slow) over the fire.\nThe fuel: a solid mass which holds and radiates heat, and must be exposed with the air.\nThe heat: the life of the fire, a sort of momentum which shifts in regard to the mixing of wood and air.\n\nThe fire inside us, of course, has different elements, but each plays a role. Each interacts with the others. I am still not entirely sure what elements make up the fire inside me. But I know I must find balance for it to thrive and last my life.\nA newfound (or lost) passion, job, or relationship may cause a shift in the balance of things. They may cause our sense of purpose to flare up or fade, or even force us to smoulder the fire to embers for a time. It can be a rollercoaster of emotions during these times. Sometimes, this result in a sort of 'Honeymoon Period,' burnout, loss of belonging, or something entirely different. Sometimes, the path to stability is not a return to the before: It's something entirely new.\nI've found that my balance is ever shifting, it's easy to get overexcited by a work problem for a week, only to leave myself feeling like a drained imposter the next, barely able to bring myself to look at my work. I'm learning to introspect on myself more, and have been actively fostering an ability to take better measure of what others, as well as my own self, are experiencing.\nBoth in lows and highs, and everywhere between, I've been starting to learn to love those serene moments of purposelessness, those glimpses of forgotten definitions of success. I've learnt that the seeds of ideas from those moments can grow in to new trees, new definitions of success. Those moments still hurt. It still hurts to find myself sitting there for hours doing nothing but stare into the void. But I've been learning that this hurt is part of the process, and it can be applied carefully to rework parts of my own 'operating system', if you will.\nAt times, things might seem purposeless, there might seem to be no definition of success to find. I'm still learning how to grope around these feelings. The best I've found is to search for a firestarter. For me, this is often found in volunteering to help organize conferences and events for my peers. I pour myself into it, I let it give my own fire life, and I cradle it the best I can, hoping not to lose it again in the afterglow.\n\n        A flame with a reflection.&nbsp;- @vanird\n        \n    \nMaintaining your momentum\nWhile we humans are ritualistic creatures, I've found that falling into a consistent ritual of life breeds discomfort and restlessness in me. It leads to more hedonic adaptation. It seems the mind &amp; soul wander, and they are much happier and more productive thriving towards their passions.\nThe act of scheduling out several weeks in advance brings me great anxiety, but scheduling the bare minimum out a few days offers me deep comfort. Guiding my day with chunks (morning, afternoon, evening, night) and desired outcomes seems to work better than planning each hour. An adapting path with a relatively solid destination.\nStumbles happen. Mistakes happen. They suck. When a project fails, there is a falling out, harm to an individual, or loss of a resource, there must be some hurt. It is my responsibility. It is also my responsibility to move forward in a good way, a way that respects this past mistake. Is it the way to make amends.\nI have been learning to attempt to predict problems which might occur, to communicate they may happen, and to address them quickly, before things get worse. This isn't always possible. Unpredictable things happen, sometimes it's noone's fault, sometimes things just happen, during these times it is often best to dwell on resolution, to temporarily redefine success to include overcoming this issue.\nBut not all things can be addressed instantaneously. We can get worked up. Emotions can run hot. Like a kimchi or a sourdough, sometimes, the best solutions have to ferment. This period of being adrift, awaiting a looming resolution is a time I greatly dread. Sometimes, though, it must be done. Sometimes it is a component of the resolution.\n\n“... Our remote descendants, (...) will marvel at how vulnerable the repository of all our potential once was, how perilous our infancy, how humble our beginnings, how many rivers we had to cross before we found our way.” ― Carl Sagan, The Pale Blue Dot (Emphasis added)\n\nBuild a firepit\nIn October 2020, I asked some folks on Twitter if they'd ever felt like they'd belonged. 35% of the 188 respondants said 'Nope.' (53% said yup, 12% just looked at the results)\nI, also, have never existed in a space I felt I belonged. I do not expect I ever will: I do not seek them. Like Herman Melville, I love to sail forbidden seas. I love to walk along the fringes between belonging and unbelonging, building bridges, forming bonds, and breaking barriers. It helps me define small successes, it helps me build and maintain purpose through longer periods.\nEven in spaces you may not feel you entirely belong, you may find refuge. Other times, you might create spaces where you find comfort. These spaces are like firepits, warm beacons in the cold, dark night. At times you might be the keeper of a fire, journeying through the dark to visit another, gathering fuel or others, or telling stories while drawing warmth from the flame. All roles are necessary for balance.\nThese spaces are necessary. While they are empty and lifeless without us, they can become vibrant microcosms of peer support, shared humour, and opportunities to lift each other up. They are valuable, they are worthwhile. They are what keep us human. They can create an environment of thriving.\nThese spaces also bring risk. The can invite conflict, unhappiness, or unrealized ambitions. These experiences themselves are valuable, and the process of learning to work through them in a good, healthy way can help offset the harm and pain they cause.\n\n\"Store my meat?

One vendor may choose to include the item because a\nparticular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that\nit enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item.\nAn implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be\nprepared to interoperate with another implementation which does\ninclude the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the\nsame vein an implementation which does include a particular option\nMUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which\ndoes not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the\noption provides.)\n\nI've come to realize I often apply them when I explore my goals and my definitions of success. It allows me to find more correct definitions of success by understanding better what must, should, should not, and must not happen.\nSome examples:\n\nWhen changing jobs, I MUST NOT choose a job that leaves me financially ruined.\nWhen travelling, I SHOULD visit any friends I have in a city, but sometimes situation may prevent it.\nI MAY abandon my pursuits to purchase new equipment, if I find it is not suitable for me upon full investigation.\n\nIn the last case, I aleviate myself of guilt for not purchasing the item, and later having buyer's remorse.\nSuccess to me\n\n        My successful (and muddy) friend, Nami.&nbsp;- Ana Hoben\n        \n    \nFor me, success is finding space where I can thrive and explore whatever I can. It's lifting others up to do the same. It's finding new experiences, learning of new cultures, and sharing in their hopes and dreams. Success is being a creature of empathy and compassion. To be one who ensures the ladder rungs I climb are reinforced for others after me. It is constantly learning, consistently teaching.\nThusfar, I have lived out many of my wildest personal dreams. I've done university level research, discovered my origins, travelled around world, realized my true identity, become a senior engineer, started my own sole proprietorship, found a life partner, and steward the life of an animal. I have enjoyed many small and large successes alongside my many failures.\nThese days, as I set my sights on the horizon, I have technology to master, my health to recover, teams to build, ecosystems to foster, nations to support, and industries to shift.\nI invite you to walk alongside me as I explore this next phase of my life. I am inspired by the efforts of projects like the T'Sou-ke Nation Solar Project, Niiwin, Plato Testing, and Skyway36. I wish to support these kinds of projects. I wish to one day support an Indigenous-led data center or ISP.\nI am drawn to the parallels between the Seventh Generation principle alongside the ideas of Carol Nichols in \"Rust: A Language for the Next 40 Years\" and Sealed Rust. My attention has turned to enabling core infrastructure that must weather the decades and help usher our species through this liminal phase as technology and humanity start to blur, and looming self-wrought disaster threatens our ongoing survival.\nThe frontiers of research enable so much, yet it is out of reach for so many. It has its own dialect and grammar, it has its own style of writing. It can be locked up by gatekeepers, the domain of fools with overwhelming greed, and no interest in sharing. I wish to unlock gates, and carve doors in barriers that block off those voices we need the most.\nI am shook to the core of my self by Russel Mean's \"Revolution and American Indians\" speech, and drawn to the ideas of Robin Wall Kimmer's \"The Serviceberry\". I am uplifted by the speakers at Natives in Tech 2020. It has given me reinvigorated definitions of success, and renewed purpose.\nI long for a more hopeful future.\nAside: Life Updates\nAs part of my ongoing long term goals, I've put my company's for-profit operations into hibernation. I do not know if they will need to return. Please, still contact me through my company about Indigenous-led efforts.\nPart of this means a close to my work on Vector. The folks there were friendly and clever teammates (and very reliable, good clients). I have some work I'll be wrapping up with them over the next weeks, and I'm hoping to add some new components in the future, but I'll no longer be a constant face there. I'm an contributor though, and will be around their chat, so this is not a goodbye to ecosystem. They have great things in store, and I'm so glad our paths crossed. I'll also no longer be offering paid-for startups/enterprises trainings, and dramatically limiting my services to anyone outside very specific clients.\nStarting on the 15th, I'll be part of the staff at Maya Data as a Senior Engineer, primarily to work on Mayastor and other (NDA'd) industrial applications.\nWhile talking with them, it turned we share many areas of research, I appreciated their culture &amp; diversity, and I am eager to help them build up their ecosystem and capacity. Block storage is relatively new to me, but I am excited to learn new ways to apply my existing talents, interact with new cultures, and immerse myself in research. If you're involved in building data centers, databases, the SPDK/DPDK ecosystem, or are interested in replicated block storage, I'd love to talk! Please reach out!\nSo much to learn. So much to explore. So much to share.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/the-entanglement-of-purpose-and-success/","title":"The Entanglement of Purpose & Success"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/the-future-with-futures/":{"body":"Recently there has been a lot of progress in the Rust language towards a robust asynchronous stack. In this article we'll take a look at what these things are, take a tour of what's available, play with some examples, and talk about how the pieces fit together.\nWe'll get started with the futures crate to start, move on to futures_cpupool, and then eventually to tokio. We will assume you have some knowledge of programming, and have at least thought about trying Rust before.\nWhat are Futures and Async?\nWhen writing code to do some action which may take some time, such as requesting a resource from a remote host, it is not always desirable to block further execution of our program. This is particularly true in the case where we are writing a web server, or performing a large number of complex calculations.\nOne way of handling this is to spawn threads and discretely slice up tasks to be distributed across threads. This is not always as convienent or as easy as it may sound. Suddenly we are forced to figure out how tasks are best split, how to allocate resources, to program against race conditions, and manage interthread communication.\nAs a community we've learnt some techniques over the years, such as CPU pools which allow a number of threads to cooperate on a task, and 'future' values which resolve to their intended value after they are finished some computation. These provide us useful and powerful tools that makes it easier, safer, and more fun to write such code.\nIf you've ever developed in Javascript you may already be familiar with asynchronous programming and the idea of Promises. Futures in Rust are very similar to this, but we're provided more control and more responsibility. With this comes greater power.\nHow We Got Here\nMuch of this async work has been in development since green threads were removed from Rust around the 0.7 release. There have been several projects related to futures and async since, their influence can be felt by what we have now and what is on the horizon.\nMuch of the async story today is founded on the ideas and lessons learned from std's green threads, mio, coroutine, and rotor. mio in particular is a foundation of nearly the entire async area of Rust. If you have interest in seeing high quality systems code I highly reccomend paying some attention to this project.\nToday, tokio and futures are the focus of much community effort. Recently Tokio accounced its first release, while futures have been relatively stable for a couple months. This has spurned a large amount of development within the community to support and leverage these new capabilities.\nGetting Started\nThe futures crate offers a number of structures and abstractions to enable building asynchronous code. By itself it's quite simple, and through its clever design it is fundamentally a zero cost abstraction. This is an important thing to keep in mind as we work through our examples: Writing code with futures should have no performance overhead over code without.\nWhen compiled futures boil down to actual state machines while still allowing us to write our code in a relatively familiar 'callback style' pattern. If you've already been using Rust then working with Futures will feel very similar to how iterators feel.\nOne of the things we'll commonly do in this section is \"sleep a little bit\" on a thread to simulate some asynchronous action. In order to do this let's create a little function:\nextern crate rand;\n\nuse std::thread;\nuse std::time::Duration;\nuse rand::distributions::{Range, IndependentSample};\n\n// This function sleeps for a bit, then returns how long it slept.\npub fn sleep_a_little_bit() -&gt; u64 {\n    let mut generator = rand::thread_rng();\n    let possibilities = Range::new(0, 1000);\n\n    let choice = possibilities.ind_sample(&amp;mut generator);\n\n    let a_little_bit = Duration::from_millis(choice);\n    thread::sleep(a_little_bit);\n    choice\n}\n\nNow that we've got that established we can use it in our first future. We'll use a oneshot to delegate a task to another thread, then pick it up back in the main thread. A oneshot is essentially a single use channel, something can be sent from the sender to the receiver, then the channel is closed.\nextern crate futures;\nextern crate fun_with_futures;\n\nuse std::thread;\nuse futures::Future;\nuse futures::sync::oneshot;\n\nuse fun_with_futures::sleep_a_little_bit;\n\nfn main() {\n    // This is a simple future built into the crate which feel sort of like\n    // one-time channels. You get a (sender, receiver) when you invoke them.\n    // Sending a value consumes that side of the channel, leaving only the reciever.\n    let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel();\n\n    // We can spawn a thread to simulate an action that takes time, like a web\n    // request. In this case it's just sleeping for a random time.\n    thread::spawn(move || {\n        println!(\"--&gt; START\");\n\n        let waited_for = sleep_a_little_bit();\n        println!(\"+++ WAITED {}\", waited_for);\n        // This consumes the sender, we can't use it afterwards.\n        tx.complete(waited_for);\n\n        println!(\"&lt;-- END\");\n    });\n\n    // Now we can wait for it to finish\n    let result = rx.wait()\n        .unwrap();\n\n    // This value will be the same as the previous \"WAITED\" output.\n    println!(\"{}\", result);\n}\n\nIf we run this example we'll see something like:\n--&gt; START\n+++ WAITED 542\n&lt;-- END\n542\n\nThe output is exactly what we might expect if we were doing this via the std channels. The code looks similar as well. At this point we're barely using Futures at all, so it shouldn't be a huge surprise that there is nothing surprising happening here. Futures start to come into their own during much more complicated tasks.\nNext, let's look at how we can work with a set of futures. In this example we'll spawn a number of threads, have them do some long running task, and then collect all of the results into a vector.\nextern crate futures;\nextern crate fun_with_futures;\n\nuse std::thread;\nuse futures::Future;\nuse futures::future::join_all;\n\nuse fun_with_futures::sleep_a_little_bit;\n\nconst NUM_OF_TASKS: usize = 10;\n\nfn main() {\n    // We'll create a set to add a bunch of recievers to.\n    let mut rx_set = Vec::new();\n\n    // Next we'll spawn up a bunch of threads doing 'something' for a bit then sending a value.\n    for index in 0..NUM_OF_TASKS {\n        // Here we create a future, this is a `oneshot` value which is consumed after use.\n        let (tx, rx) = futures::oneshot();\n        // Add the reciever to the vector we created earlier so we can collect on it.\n        rx_set.push(rx);\n\n        // Spawning up a thread means things won't be executed sequentially, so this will actually\n        // behave like an asynchronous value, so we can actually see how they work.\n        thread::spawn(move || {\n            println!(\"{} --&gt; START\", index);\n\n            let waited_for = sleep_a_little_bit();\n            println!(\"{} +++ WAITED {}\", index, waited_for);\n\n            // Here we send back the index (and consume the sender).\n            tx.complete(index);\n\n            println!(\"{} &lt;-- END\", index);\n        });\n    }\n\n    // `join_all` lets us join together the set of futures.\n    let result = join_all(rx_set)\n        // Block until they all are resolved.\n        .wait()\n        // Check they all came out in the right order.\n        .map(|values|\n            values.iter()\n                .enumerate()\n                .all(|(index, &amp;value)| index == value))\n        // We'll be lazy and just unwrap the result.\n        .unwrap();\n\n    println!(\"Job is done. Values returned in order: {}\", result);\n}\n\nThe map call behaves just like the map of an Option&lt;T&gt; or a Result&lt;T,E&gt;. It transforms some Future&lt;T&gt; into some Future&lt;U&gt;.  Running this example in output similar to the following:\n0 --&gt; START\n1 --&gt; START\n3 --&gt; START\n2 --&gt; START\n4 --&gt; START\n5 --&gt; START\n6 --&gt; START\n7 --&gt; START\n8 --&gt; START\n9 --&gt; START\n4 +++ WAITED 124\n4 &lt;-- END\n1 +++ WAITED 130\n1 &lt;-- END\n0 +++ WAITED 174\n0 &lt;-- END\n2 +++ WAITED 268\n2 &lt;-- END\n6 +++ WAITED 445\n6 &lt;-- END\n3 +++ WAITED 467\n3 &lt;-- END\n9 +++ WAITED 690\n9 &lt;-- END\n8 +++ WAITED 694\n8 &lt;-- END\n5 +++ WAITED 743\n5 &lt;-- END\n7 +++ WAITED 802\n7 &lt;-- END\nJob is done. Values returned in order: true\n\nIn this example we can observe that all of the futures started, waited various times, then finished. They did not finish in order, but the resulting vector did come out in the correct order. Again, this result is not entirely surprising and we could have done something very similar with std's channels.\n\nRemember, futures are a basic building block, not a batteries included solution. They are intended to be built on top of.\n\nWe'll cover one more example which will feel fairly familiar to people who have used the channels from std, then we'll start doing more interesting stuff.\nThe next primitive from futures we'll use is the futures::sync::mpsc::channel which behaves similar to the std::sync::mpsc::channel. We'll build a channel then pass off the sender tx to another thread, then we'll fire a series of messages along the channel. The rx side of the channel can then be used similarly to an Iterator.\nextern crate futures;\nextern crate fun_with_futures;\n\nuse std::thread;\nuse futures::future::{Future, ok};\nuse futures::stream::Stream;\nuse futures::sync::mpsc;\nuse futures::Sink;\n\nuse fun_with_futures::sleep_a_little_bit;\n\nconst BUFFER_SIZE: usize = 10;\n\nfn main() {\n    // A channel represents a stream and will yield a series of futures.\n\n    // We're using a bounded channel here with a limited size.\n    let (mut tx, rx) = mpsc::channel(BUFFER_SIZE);\n\n    thread::spawn(move || {\n        println!(\"--&gt; START THREAD\");\n        // We'll have the stream produce a series of values.\n        for _ in 0..10 {\n\n            let waited_for = sleep_a_little_bit();\n            println!(\"+++ THREAD WAITED {}\", waited_for);\n\n            // When we `send()` a value it consumes the sender. Returning\n            // a 'new' sender which we have to handle. In this case we just\n            // re-assign.\n            match tx.send(waited_for).wait() {\n                // Why do we need to do this? This is how back pressure is implemented.\n                // When the buffer is full `wait()` will block.\n                Ok(new_tx) =&gt; tx = new_tx,\n                Err(_) =&gt; panic!(\"Oh no!\"),\n            }\n\n        }\n        println!(\"&lt;-- END THREAD\");\n        // Here the stream is dropped.\n    });\n\n    // We can `.fold()` like we would an iterator. In fact we can do many\n    // things like we would an iterator.\n    let sum = rx.fold(0, |acc, val| {\n            // Notice when we run that this is happening after each item of\n            // the stream resolves, like an iterator.\n            println!(\"+++ FOLDING {} INTO {}\", val, acc);\n            // `ok()` is a simple way to say \"Yes this worked.\"\n            // `err()` also exists.\n            ok(acc + val)\n        })\n        .wait()\n        .unwrap();\n    println!(\"SUM {}\", sum);\n}\n\nThe output will be similar to the following:\n--&gt; START THREAD\n+++ THREAD WAITED 166\n+++ FOLDING 166 INTO 0\n+++ THREAD WAITED 554\n+++ FOLDING 554 INTO 166\n+++ THREAD WAITED 583\n+++ FOLDING 583 INTO 720\n+++ THREAD WAITED 175\n+++ FOLDING 175 INTO 1303\n+++ THREAD WAITED 136\n+++ FOLDING 136 INTO 1478\n+++ THREAD WAITED 155\n+++ FOLDING 155 INTO 1614\n+++ THREAD WAITED 90\n+++ FOLDING 90 INTO 1769\n+++ THREAD WAITED 986\n+++ FOLDING 986 INTO 1859\n+++ THREAD WAITED 830\n+++ FOLDING 830 INTO 2845\n+++ THREAD WAITED 21\n&lt;-- END THREAD\n+++ FOLDING 21 INTO 3675\nSUM 3696\n\nNow that we're familiar with these basic ideas we can move on to working with futures_cpupool.\nDipping Our Toes Into the CPU Pool\nEarlier we alluded to the idea of using futures with a CPU pool where we didn't have to manage which thread did which work, but in our examples so far we've still had to manually spin up threads. So let's fix that.\nThe futures_cpupool crate offers us this functionality. Let's take a look at a basic example which does nearly the same thing as our second example above:\nextern crate futures;\nextern crate fun_with_futures;\nextern crate futures_cpupool;\n\nuse futures::future::{Future, join_all};\nuse futures_cpupool::Builder;\n\nuse fun_with_futures::sleep_a_little_bit;\n\n// Feel free to change me!\nconst NUM_OF_TASKS: usize = 10;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Creates a CpuPool with workers equal to the cores on the machine.\n    let pool = Builder::new()\n        .create();\n\n    // Create a batch of futures.\n    let futures = (0..NUM_OF_TASKS)\n        // Tell the pool to run a closure.\n        .map(|index| pool.spawn_fn(move || {\n\n            println!(\"{} --&gt; START\", index);\n            let waited_for = sleep_a_little_bit();\n            println!(\"{} &lt;-- WAITED {}\", index, waited_for);\n\n            // We need to return a result!\n            // Why? Futures were implemented with I/O in mind!\n            let result: Result&lt;_, ()&gt; = Ok(index);\n\n            result\n        })).collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;();\n\n    // We wait on all the futures here and see if they came back in order.\n    let result = join_all(futures)\n        // Check they all came out in the right order.\n        .map(|values|\n            values.iter()\n                .enumerate()\n                .all(|(index, &amp;value)| index == value))\n        .wait()\n        .unwrap();\n    println!(\"Job is done. Values returned in order: {:?}\", result)\n}\n\nThis outputs something similar to the following:\n0 --&gt; START\n1 --&gt; START\n2 --&gt; START\n3 --&gt; START\n4 --&gt; START\n5 --&gt; START\n6 --&gt; START\n7 --&gt; START\n0 &lt;-- WAITED 37\n8 --&gt; START\n2 &lt;-- WAITED 86\n9 --&gt; START\n3 &lt;-- WAITED 110\n6 &lt;-- WAITED 326\n9 &lt;-- WAITED 458\n4 &lt;-- WAITED 568\n5 &lt;-- WAITED 748\n7 &lt;-- WAITED 757\n1 &lt;-- WAITED 794\n8 &lt;-- WAITED 838\nJob is done. Values returned in order: true\n\nThis time we didn't need to manage threads or which thread does what. The pool just handled it for us. This is pretty handy. We can be rather arbitrary with what we do with the pool. For example different spawned tasks can return different types:\nextern crate futures;\nextern crate fun_with_futures;\nextern crate futures_cpupool;\n\nuse futures::future::Future;\nuse futures_cpupool::Builder;\n\nuse fun_with_futures::sleep_a_little_bit;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Creates a CpuPool with workers equal to the cores on the machine.\n    let pool = Builder::new()\n        .create();\n\n    // Note the two spawns return different types.\n    let returns_string = pool.spawn_fn(move || {\n        sleep_a_little_bit();\n        // We need to return a result!\n        let result: Result&lt;_, ()&gt; = Ok(\"First\");\n\n        result\n    });\n\n    let returns_integer = pool.spawn_fn(move || {\n        sleep_a_little_bit();\n        // We need to return a result!\n        let result: Result&lt;_, ()&gt; = Ok(2);\n\n        result\n    });\n\n    // Wait for the jobs to finish.\n    let resulting_string = returns_string.wait()\n        .unwrap();\n\n    let resulting_integer = returns_integer.wait()\n        .unwrap();\n    \n    println!(\"{}, {}\", resulting_string, resulting_integer);\n    // Returns `First, 2`\n}\n\nThis means that we can create a CPU pool and delegate arbitrary tasks to it throughout the lifetime of our program. It may be that you want to create multiple pools to prevent starvation, for example a pool with 2 workers for network connections, and another with 2 workers for delayed jobs.\nVisiting Tokio's Core\nThe tokio project has been developed closely alongside of futures and the projects share many authors. The project has a number of crates intended for building asynchronous applications. In the tokio-core crate there are things like the main event loop, TCP handlers, and timeouts. Building on top of that are crates such as tokio-proto and tokio-service which build on top of these constructs.\nWe'll start with just tokio-core and doing a simple HTTP GET request. Note since we're not actually using a HTTP client we need to handle all the details ourselves. Here's what that looks like:\nextern crate futures;\nextern crate tokio_core;\n\nuse std::net::ToSocketAddrs;\nuse futures::future::Future;\nuse tokio_core::io::{read_to_end, write_all};\nuse tokio_core::reactor::Core;\nuse tokio_core::net::TcpStream;\n\nconst DOMAIN: &amp;'static str = \"google.com\";\nconst PORT: u16 = 80;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Create the event loop that will drive this server.\n    let mut core = Core::new().unwrap();\n    let handle = core.handle();\n\n    // Get a socket address from a domain name.\n    let socket_addr = (DOMAIN, PORT).to_socket_addrs()\n        .map(|iter| iter.collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;())\n        .unwrap()[0];\n    \n    // Connect with a handle to the core event loop.\n    let response = TcpStream::connect(&amp;socket_addr, &amp;handle)\n        .and_then(|socket| {\n            // Write a raw GET request onto the socket.\n            write_all(socket, format!(\"\\\n                GET / HTTP/1.0\\r\\n\\\n                Host: {}\\r\\n\\\n                \\r\\n\\\n            \", DOMAIN))\n        }).and_then(|(socket, _request)| {\n            // Read the response into a buffer.\n            read_to_end(socket, Vec::new())\n        });\n\n    // Fire the task off onto the event loop.\n    let (_socket, data) = core.run(response).unwrap();\n\n    // Parse the data and output it.\n    println!(\"{}\", String::from_utf8(data).unwrap());\n}\n\nThis looks a bit different than what we've previously been doing with our futures. Core::new() is how we create an event loop, or 'Reactor', which we can get Handles which we use when issuing tasks such as TcpStream::Connect. You can learn more about the basics of the Reactor here.\nWorking with the types provided by Tokio is slightly different than working with those provided by std, however many of the ideas and concepts are the same. Many of the changes are due to the differences between syncronous and asynchronous I/O.\nNear the end of the example we have core.run() which is a way to fire off one off tasks and get a return value from them, similar to how we were using futures. Tokio also provides a spawn() and spawn_fn() functions which are executed in the background and must do their own handling of errors, making it ideal for tasks such as responding to new connections.\nLet's play with spawn_fn() in our next example by making a simple server.\nextern crate futures;\nextern crate tokio_core;\n\nuse std::net::SocketAddr;\nuse futures::future::Future;\nuse futures::Stream;\nuse tokio_core::io::{read_to_end, write_all};\nuse tokio_core::reactor::Core;\nuse tokio_core::net::TcpListener;\n\nconst LISTEN_TO: &amp;'static str = \"0.0.0.0:8080\";\n\nfn main() {\n    // Create the event loop that will drive this server.\n    let mut core = Core::new().unwrap();\n    let handle = core.handle();\n\n    // Get a SocketAddr\n    let socket: SocketAddr = LISTEN_TO.parse()\n        .unwrap();\n    \n    // Start listening.\n    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&amp;socket, &amp;handle)\n        .unwrap();\n    \n    // For each incoming connection...\n    let server = listener.incoming().for_each(|(stream, _client_addr)| {\n        // Spawn the task on the reactor.\n        handle.spawn_fn(|| {\n            // Read until EOF\n            read_to_end(stream, Vec::new())\n                .and_then(|(socket, data)| {\n                    // Write the recieved data.\n                    write_all(socket, data)\n                })\n                // Errors have to be handled internally.\n                .map(|_| ())\n                .map_err(|_| ())\n        });\n\n        Ok(()) // keep accepting connections\n    });\n\n    // Run the reactor.\n    core.run(server).unwrap();\n}\n// Throw some data at it with `echo \"Test\" | nc 127.0.0.1 8080`\n\nRunning echo \"Test\" | nc 127.0.0.1 8080 in another terminal echos back the data sent. \nHowever, our example here isn't very useful, or idiomatic! For example, we can't use something like telnet or curl to interact with it. It's a start though. Let's do better.\nWe'll improve on our previous example by using a Codec. Codecs allow us to describe how to encode and decode the frames a TcpStream (or anything else that can be framed()). It asks us to define an In and an Out type as well as encode() and decode() functions.\nHere's what our example with EchoCodec could look like:\nextern crate futures;\nextern crate tokio_core;\n\nuse std::net::SocketAddr;\nuse futures::future::Future;\nuse futures::Stream;\nuse std::io::Result;\nuse tokio_core::io::{Codec, EasyBuf, Io};\nuse tokio_core::reactor::Core;\nuse tokio_core::net::TcpListener;\n\nconst LISTEN_TO: &amp;'static str = \"0.0.0.0:8080\";\n\n// Codecs can have state, but this one doesn't.\nstruct EchoCodec;\nimpl Codec for EchoCodec {\n    // Associated types which define the data taken/produced by the codec.\n    type In = Vec&lt;u8&gt;;\n    type Out = Vec&lt;u8&gt;;\n\n    // Returns `Ok(Some(In))` if there is a frame, `Ok(None)` if it needs more data.\n    fn decode(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;mut EasyBuf) -&gt; Result&lt;Option&lt;Self::In&gt;&gt; {\n        // It's important to drain the buffer!\n        let amount = buf.len();\n        let data = buf.drain_to(amount);\n        Ok(Some(data.as_slice().into()))\n    }\n\n    // Produces a frame.\n    fn encode(&amp;mut self, msg: Self::Out, buf: &amp;mut Vec&lt;u8&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n        buf.extend(msg);\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Create the event loop that will drive this server.\n    let mut core = Core::new().unwrap();\n    let handle = core.handle();\n\n    // Get a SocketAddr\n    let socket: SocketAddr = LISTEN_TO.parse()\n        .unwrap();\n    \n    // Start listening.\n    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&amp;socket, &amp;handle)\n        .unwrap();\n    \n    // For each incoming connection...\n    let server = listener.incoming().for_each(|(stream, _client_addr)| {\n        // Spawn the task on the reactor.\n        handle.spawn_fn(|| {\n            // Using our codec, split the in/out into frames.\n            let (writer, reader) = stream.framed(EchoCodec).split();\n            // Here we just sink any data recieved directly back into the socket.\n            reader.forward(writer)\n                // We need to handle errors internally.\n                .map(|_| ())\n                .map_err(|_| ())\n        });\n\n        Ok(()) // keep accepting connections\n    });\n\n    // Run the reactor.\n    core.run(server).unwrap();\n}\n// Throw some data at it with `echo \"Test\" | nc 127.0.0.1 8080`\n\nIf you test this out you'll find the same behaviour as the previous example. With a little change we can even make it handle lines instead of entire messages, we'll borrow some code from Tokio's examples to do this:\n// Codecs can have state, but this one doesn't.\nstruct EchoCodec;\nimpl Codec for EchoCodec {\n    // Associated types which define the data taken/produced by the codec.\n    type In = String;\n    type Out = String;\n\n    // Returns `Ok(Some(In))` if there is a frame, `Ok(None)` if it needs more data.\n    fn decode(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;mut EasyBuf) -&gt; io::Result&lt;Option&lt;Self::In&gt;&gt; {\n        match buf.as_slice().iter().position(|&amp;b| b == b'\\n') {\n            Some(i) =&gt; {\n                // Drain from the buffer (this is important!)\n                let line = buf.drain_to(i);\n\n                // Also remove the '\\n'.\n                buf.drain_to(1);\n\n                // Turn this data into a UTF string and return it in a Frame.\n                match str::from_utf8(line.as_slice()) {\n                    Ok(s) =&gt; Ok(Some(s.to_string())),\n                    Err(_) =&gt; Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other,\n                                                \"invalid UTF-8\")),\n                }\n            },\n            None =&gt; Ok(None),\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Produces a frame.\n    fn encode(&amp;mut self, msg: Self::Out, buf: &amp;mut Vec&lt;u8&gt;) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n        buf.extend(msg.as_bytes());\n        // Add the necessary newline.\n        buf.push(b'\\n');\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n\nRunning this example you can connect with nc 127.0.0.1 8080 and send some lines of text, then get them back. Notice how we didn't have to change the rest of the code at all in order to make this change? All we had to do was change the behaivor of the codec.\nNow let's try making a codec that encodes and decodes HTTP 1.1 GET and POST requests made from curl that we can build on later:\nenum ExampleRequest {\n    Get { url: String },\n    Post { url: String, content: String },\n}\n\nenum ExampleResponse {\n    NotFound,\n    Ok { content: String },\n}\n\n// Codecs can have state, but this one doesn't.\nstruct ExampleCodec;\nimpl Codec for ExampleCodec {\n    // Associated types which define the data taken/produced by the codec.\n    type In = ExampleRequest;\n    type Out = ExampleResponse;\n\n    // Returns `Ok(Some(In))` if there is a frame, `Ok(None)` if it needs more data.\n    fn decode(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;mut EasyBuf) -&gt; io::Result&lt;Option&lt;Self::In&gt;&gt; {\n        let content_so_far = String::from_utf8_lossy(buf.as_slice())\n            .to_mut()\n            .clone();\n\n        // Request headers/content in HTTP 1.1 are split by double newline.\n        match content_so_far.find(\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\") {\n            Some(i) =&gt; {\n                // Drain from the buffer (this is important!)\n                let mut headers = {\n                    let tmp = buf.drain_to(i);\n                    String::from_utf8_lossy(tmp.as_slice())\n                        .to_mut()\n                        .clone()\n                };\n                buf.drain_to(4); // Also remove the '\\r\\n\\r\\n'.\n\n                // Get the method and drain.\n                let method = headers.find(\" \")\n                    .map(|len| headers.drain(..len).collect::&lt;String&gt;());\n\n                headers.drain(..1); // Get rid of the space.\n\n                // Since the method was drained we can do it again to get the url.\n                let url = headers.find(\" \")\n                    .map(|len| headers.drain(..len).collect::&lt;String&gt;())\n                    .unwrap_or_default();\n\n                // The content of a POST.\n                let content = {\n                    let remaining = buf.len();\n                    let tmp = buf.drain_to(remaining);\n                    String::from_utf8_lossy(tmp.as_slice())\n                        .to_mut()\n                        .clone()\n                };\n\n                match method {\n                    Some(ref method) if method == \"GET\" =&gt; {\n                        Ok(Some(ExampleRequest::Get { url: url }))\n                    },\n                    Some(ref method) if method == \"POST\" =&gt; {\n                        Ok(Some(ExampleRequest::Post { url: url, content: content }))\n                    },\n                    _ =&gt; Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, \"invalid\"))\n                }\n            },\n            None =&gt; Ok(None),\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Produces a frame.\n    fn encode(&amp;mut self, msg: Self::Out, buf: &amp;mut Vec&lt;u8&gt;) -&gt; io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n        match msg {\n            ExampleResponse::NotFound =&gt; {\n                buf.extend(b\"HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\\r\\n\");\n                buf.extend(b\"Content-Length: 0\\r\\n\");\n                buf.extend(b\"Connection: close\\r\\n\");\n            },\n            ExampleResponse::Ok { content: v } =&gt;  {\n                buf.extend(b\"HTTP/1.1 200 Ok\\r\\n\");\n                buf.extend(format!(\"Content-Length: {}\\r\\n\", v.len()).as_bytes());\n                buf.extend(b\"Connection: close\\r\\n\");\n                buf.extend(b\"\\r\\n\");\n                buf.extend(v.as_bytes());\n            }\n        }\n        buf.extend(b\"\\r\\n\");\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n\nLet's be honest with ourselves here, this is very naive and is obviously incomplete! However it works for curl -vvvv localhost:8080 and curl -vvvv localhost:8080 --data hello, and we got to learn a bit about how to use Tokio. So far so good! Let's build on it.\nServices and Protocols\ntokio-core is, by definition, minimal. The tokio-proto and tokio-service crates build atop it to create common abstractions which we can use for various applications.\nIn this next example we'll build off our previous example of our naive HTTP server. Since the code chunks are starting to get significant let's work with isolated bits and we'll show the full example at the very end.\nOur goal will be to build an ultra simple web server that responds to GET/POST requests. A POST to /cats with the data meow should return a 200 OK with the old value (if any) as the data, and any future GET to /cats should return meow as well until it is replaced. Our goal is simplicity and learning, not being robust or perfect.\nFirst, we'll go ahead and define our protocol. We'll use a simple pipelined, non-streaming protocol. This code is quite generic and will generally look quite similar for different implementations. tokio-proto allow us to define the general style of our network. The tokio-proto docs provide a good explanation of the differences.\nuse tokio_proto::pipeline::ServerProto;\n\n// Like codecs, protocols can carry state too!\nstruct ExampleProto;\nimpl&lt;T: Io + 'static&gt; ServerProto&lt;T&gt; for ExampleProto {\n    // These types must match the corresponding codec types:\n    type Request = &lt;ExampleCodec as Codec&gt;::In;\n    type Response = &lt;ExampleCodec as Codec&gt;::Out;\n\n    /// A bit of boilerplate to hook in the codec:\n    type Transport = Framed&lt;T, ExampleCodec&gt;;\n    type BindTransport = Result&lt;Self::Transport, io::Error&gt;;\n    fn bind_transport(&amp;self, io: T) -&gt; Self::BindTransport {\n        Ok(io.framed(ExampleCodec))\n    }\n}\n\nThe service is less generic, and handles our little \"database\" inside of it. Due to the Proto and the Codec already handling most of the complicated bits, it's fairly straightforward. Services are reusable abstractions that operate over protocols.\nHere's what our little HTTP example looks like:\n// Surprise! Services can also carry state.\n#[derive(Default)]\nstruct ExampleService {\n    db: Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl Service for ExampleService {\n    // These types must match the corresponding protocol types:\n    type Request = &lt;ExampleCodec as Codec&gt;::In;\n    type Response = &lt;ExampleCodec as Codec&gt;::Out;\n\n    // For non-streaming protocols, service errors are always io::Error\n    type Error = io::Error;\n\n    // The future for computing the response; box it for simplicity.\n    type Future = BoxFuture&lt;Self::Response, Self::Error&gt;;\n\n    // Produce a future for computing a response from a request.\n    fn call(&amp;self, req: Self::Request) -&gt; Self::Future {\n        println!(\"Request: {:?}\", req);\n        \n        // Deref the database.\n        let mut db = self.db.lock()\n            .unwrap(); // This should only panic in extreme cirumstances.\n        \n        // Return the appropriate value.\n        let res = match req {\n            ExampleRequest::Get { url: url } =&gt; {\n                match db.get(&amp;url) {\n                    Some(v) =&gt; ExampleResponse::Ok { content: v.clone() },\n                    None =&gt; ExampleResponse::NotFound,\n                }\n            },\n            ExampleRequest::Post { url: url, content: content } =&gt; {\n                match db.insert(url, content) {\n                    Some(v) =&gt; ExampleResponse::Ok { content: v },\n                    None =&gt; ExampleResponse::Ok { content: \"\".into() },\n                }\n            }\n        };\n        println!(\"Database: {:?}\", *db);\n\n        // Return the result.\n        future::finished(res).boxed()\n    }\n}\n\nAt this point we have all the pieces and just need to put them all together. This requires some changes to our main() function like so:\nfn main() {\n    // Get a SocketAddr\n    let socket: SocketAddr = LISTEN_TO.parse()\n        .unwrap();\n    \n    // Create a server with the protocol.\n    let server = TcpServer::new(ExampleProto, socket);\n    \n    // Create a database instance to provide to spawned services.\n    let db = Arc::new(Mutex::new(HashMap::new()));\n\n    // Serve requests with our created service and a handle to the database.    \n    server.serve(move || Ok(ExampleService { db: db.clone() }));\n}\n// Throw some data at it with `curl 127.0.0.1 8080/foo` and `curl 127.0.0.1 8080 --data bar`\n\nTesting it out:\n$ curl localhost:8080/bear           \n$ curl localhost:8080/bear --data foo\n$ curl localhost:8080/bear           \nfoo%                                                                                                                                                                   $ curl localhost:8080/bear --data bar\nfoo%\n$ curl localhost:8080/bear\nbar%\n\nThis is great, we've created a little network connected database with a \"REST-ish\" API.

I'm happy to report it was, and still is, super cool. Plans diverted significantly at the very start of the project as it was discovered that the \"menagerie\" of certificates we wanted to build already existed.\nWhat joy! In order to avoid any \"not-invented-here\" syndrome problems we pivoted, like  a failing startup, and I moved to become a contributor to BadSSL. One of my mentors, April King, happened to already be a contributor to BadSSL and helped me get acquainted with the repository and the maintainer, Lucas Garron.\nI was glad to discover that BadSSL is a Jekyll site. I've used Jekyll a number of times for different tasks and really enjoy working with the program. BadSSL is deployed on the Google Cloud Platform and is primarily powered via extensive nginx configurations.\nSuperfish and Dell Fumble\nIn a couple spectacular fumbles by Dell and Lenovo we got a couple really interesting new specimens. Lenovo's bundled adware 'Superfish' CA and Dell's Curious Customer Service CA were discovered and compromised. We subsequently added https://superfish.badssl.com/, https://edellroot.badssl.com/, and https://dsdtestprovider.badssl.com/ so that potentially affected users could easily test their systems.\nThe Spider's Web\nOne of the problems we identified with the current version of BadSSL was the tangle of files one needs to create or manipulate to generate a new subdomain. As an example, adding the above mentioned 3 subdomains required changing over 18 files. After doing some research I discovered that we could harness the power of Jekyll's _data files to our advantage. I have a Pull Request I've been trying to land that will greatly simplify this process and permit further automation.\nI really enjoy working with these types of templating and data transformation problems. I've been exploring using Jekyll Generators automate the creation of some remaining crud files however I haven't made any solid progress on that yet.\nA Whale of a Time\nThose gosh darn whale containers are really hard to set up sometimes. BadSSL had a Dockerfile however it wasn't harnessing all of the features it could have. For example Jekyll was called outside of the container, and required the user to have installed it already. April and I spent many hours on IRC coaxing around various steps of the build system to find a happy medium between speed and heft. I think moving forward using a container might be the right choice for production as well.\nI'd like to set up a shared-volume based command for filesystem watching, however this will likely involve figuring out how to hook onto post-builds in Jekyll to fire Nginx restarts. Then we could use something like jekyll serve inside the container while updating the development copy of the website from outside the container.\nWeaving a Tale\nWithout an explanation of what's being tested it's hard to argue that having tests are worthwhile! BadSSL (until the data branch merges) has no comprehensive descriptions about what different certificates represent contextually. The data branch, and soon production, features a full set of descriptions embedded into each page as well as on the index.\nOne thing I learned all too well while compiling this information is that security is very complicated. There are so many varieties of cipher suites supporting (or not) many different browsers, operating systems, esoteric configurations, and eras of computing. It makes me worry when I see crypto libraries that advertise configurability these days. I'd much rather see simple and foolproof.\nSmooth Like Butter\nDescriptions for each specimen of our little menagerie was great, but it made the front page mind-blowingly wordy. So what's a bear to do but resort to tooltips? After looking at various options it was kind of conclusive that most tooltip libraries wouldn't fit our desired use case. We wanted tooltips that wouldn't be invasive, that could include HTML like links, and worked in situations where the client had Javascript disabled.\nSo instead I wrote up some CSS animations to handle the task. You can see a demo below:\n\n\n    \n        Hover your mouse over me!\n        \n            I'm a test description! Typically this is a sentence or two, so it tends to need two lines.\n        \n    \n    \n        Hover your mouse over me!\n        \n            I'm a test description!

Her and her partner welcome a new life recently. I'm very happy for both of them and encourage her to take her time to adjust to these new changes. We can continue our work together when she is ready.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/the-menagerie-of-badssl/","title":"The Menagerie of Badssl"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/the-path-to-rust-on-the-web/":{"body":"Recently there has been quite a bit of talk about WebAssembly, a new format for code for the web. It is a compile target for languages like C and Rust that enables us to write, and run, code from these languages in our browser.\nIn the interest of learning more about this technology (and to avoid writing more Javascript) let's explore together and get our hands dirty!\n\nDisclaimer: WebAssembly is stabilized, but most implementations are not. The information contained here may become out of date or be incorrect, despite working at the time of writing.\n\n\nBefore we start please make sure you're using the current (or developer) version of Firefox or Chrome. You can check out about:config or chrome://flags/ and make sure wasm related things are enabled.\nWhat Are We Looking At?\nWebAssembly (or wasm) describes an execution environment which browsers can implement within their Javascript Virtual Machines. It's a way to run code in place of, or alongside, Javascript.\nWebAssembly can be thought of as similar to asm.js. Indeed, we can use Emscripten compiler to target both.\nMost existing documentation discusses how to build C, C++, or Rust into wasm, but there is nothing excluding languages like Ruby or Python from working as well.\nInstalling The Tools\nWe'll need two things to get started with WebAssembly and Rust, assuming you already have a functional development environment otherwise (That is, you have build-essential, XCode, or the like installed.)\nFirst, Rust. You can review here for a more long winded explanation of how to do this, or you can just run the following and accept the defaults:\ncurl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\n\nOpen a new terminal or run source $HOME/.cargo/env, then we'll add the wasm32-unknown-emscripten compile target via rustup as well:\nrustup target add wasm32-unknown-emscripten\n\nWe can use this command to install other targets, found via rustup target list, as well.\nNext we need to set up Emscripten via emsdk. We'll use the incoming version of Emscripten in order to get the best output. Note: This may take awhile (an hour!).\ncurl https://s3.amazonaws.com/mozilla-games/emscripten/releases/emsdk-portable.tar.gz | tar -xv -C ~/\ncd ~/emsdk-portable\n./emsdk update\n./emsdk install sdk-incoming-64bit\n./emsdk activate sdk-incoming-64bit\n\nAt this point Emscripten is installed. The last command will instruct us how to add the binaries to our path for permanent usage, or we can just source ./emsdk_env.sh for temporary fun.\nAt this point emcc -v should report something similar to this:\n$ emcc -v\nINFO:root:(Emscripten: Running sanity checks)\nemcc (Emscripten gcc/clang-like replacement + linker emulating GNU ld) 1.37.9\nclang version 4.0.0 (https://github.com/kripken/emscripten-fastcomp-clang/ d4b1e0785f1ee15ab78207de4380e82e3407c6ea) (https://github.com/kripken/emscripten-fastcomp/ 09aaa022c31e247bfb7b00882372733e6b27f007) (emscripten 1.37.9 : 1.37.9)\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin16.4.0\nThread model: posix\nInstalledDir: /Users/hoverbear/emsdk-portable/clang/fastcomp/build_incoming_64/bin\nINFO:root:(Emscripten: Running sanity checks)\n\nNow, let's kick the tires a bit!\nFirst Experiment: Standalone Executable\nIn our first experiment we'll compile some Rust code into wasm and have it run in the browser console. We'll try a basic code sample to ensure things are working as we expect. We won't try to do any crate importing, DOM manipulation, or network access yet, but that's coming later!\nLet's create our project, we'll use this same project for our future experiments as well. We need to set this to nightly (at least at the time or writing) to have our demos work.\ncargo init wasm-demo --bin\nrustup override set nightly\n\nThen we'll put our first code sample into src/main.rs:\n#[derive(Debug)]\nenum Direction { North, South, East, West }\n\nfn is_north(dir: Direction) -&gt; bool {\n    match dir {\n        Direction::North =&gt; true,\n        _ =&gt; false,\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let points = Direction::South;\n    println!(\"{:?}\", points);\n    let compass = is_north(points);\n    println!(\"{}\", compass);\n}\n\nRunning this normally yields what we would expect:\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling wasm-demo v0.1.0 (file:///Users/hoverbear/git/rust/wasm-demo)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.89 secs\n     Running `target/debug/wasm-demo`\nSouth\nfalse\n\nNow, let's get the same thing in our browser! We can build our executable for the wasm target by using the --target flag.\n$ cargo build --target=wasm32-unknown-emscripten --release\n$ tree target\ntarget\n└── wasm32-unknown-emscripten\n    └── release\n        ├── build\n        ├── deps\n        │   ├── wasm_demo-9c23ae9a241f12fa.asm.js\n        │   ├── wasm_demo-9c23ae9a241f12fa.js\n        │   └── wasm_demo-9c23ae9a241f12fa.wasm\n        ├── examples\n        ├── incremental\n        ├── native\n        ├── wasm-demo.d\n        └── wasm-demo.js\n\ncargo created several files in target/wasm32-unknown-emscripten/release/deps/ for us. Of primary interest are the .wasm and .js files.\nWhy do we get both a wasm and a js? Wasn't the whole point of this to not use Javascript? Turns out we need some Javascript glue code to fetch, initialize, and configure it.\nAt this point we can't really use the created files, since we don't have a webpage to import them into! Let's work on that. We can create a site/index.html with the following content:\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;script&gt;\n            // This is read and used by `site.js`\n            var Module = {\n                wasmBinaryFile: \"site.wasm\"\n            }\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;script src=\"site.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nNext we need to set up some way to get the generated files from the target/ folder into the site/ folder. make is a good solution for this, so let's make a Makefile. (Makefiles require tabs, not spaces!)\nSHELL := /bin/bash\n\nall:\n\tcargo build --target=wasm32-unknown-emscripten --release\n\tmkdir -p site\n\tfind target/wasm32-unknown-emscripten/release/deps -type f -name \"*.wasm\" | xargs -I {} cp {} site/site.wasm\n\tfind target/wasm32-unknown-emscripten/release/deps -type f ! -name \"*.asm.js\" -name \"*.js\" | xargs -I {} cp {} site/site.js\n\nFinally, test it with make.\n$ tree site\nsite\n├── index.html\n├── site.js\n└── site.wasm\n\nLet's test our generated code by running python -m SimpleHTTPServer, browsing to http://localhost:8000/site/, and opening the browser console.\nIn the browser console you should see:\ntrying binaryen method: native-wasm\nasynchronously preparing wasm\nbinaryen method succeeded.\nThe character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.\nSouth\nfalse\n\nExcellent! It worked!\nSecond Experiment: Imports\nIn our first example we just used a basic enum and some print statements, nothing too exciting. Let's do something more exciting and work with iterators.\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\nuse Direction::*;\n\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]\nenum Direction { North, South, East, West }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut users_facing = HashMap::new();\n    users_facing.insert(\"Alice\", North);\n    users_facing.insert(\"Bob\", South);\n    users_facing.insert(\"Carol\", East);\n\n    let users_not_facing_north = users_facing.iter()\n        .filter(|&amp;(_, d)| *d != North)\n        .collect::&lt;HashMap&lt;_,_&gt;&gt;();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", users_not_facing_north);\n}\n\n\nBuilding this code again with make we can navigate to the page again in our browser. This should output:\n{\"Carol\": East, \"Bob\": South}\n\nExcellent! So importing things from std seems to work okay. How about other crates? Let's try using itertools. Add the following to the Cargo.toml:\n[dependencies]\nitertools = \"*\"\n\nThen we can go and try to use it.\nextern crate itertools;\n\nuse itertools::Itertools;\nuse Direction::*;\n\n\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]\nenum Direction { North, South, East, West }\n\nfn main() {\n    let directions = vec![North, North, South, East, West, West];\n\n    let unique_directions = directions.iter()\n        .unique()\n        .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", unique_directions);\n}\n\nBuilding and visiting the page again we see the following output:\n[North, South, East, West]\n\nOkay that was simple! What about something a bit more complicated, like serde, which lets us serialize and deserialize various formats? This will be important for an application which needs to parse responses from APIs!\nChanging the Cargo.toml and the main.rs:\n[dependencies]\nserde_json = \"*\"\nserde_derive = \"*\"\nserde = \"*\"\nextern crate serde_json;\n#[macro_use] extern crate serde_derive;\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\nenum Direction { North, South, East, West }\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\nstruct Example {\n    favorite_animal: String,\n    favorite_direction: Direction\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let data = r#\" { \"favorite_animal\": \"Bear\", \"favorite_direction\": \"North\" } \"#;\n    let parsed: Example = serde_json::from_str(data).unwrap();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", parsed);\n}\n\nBuilding, and viewing it in the browser console yields:\nExample { favorite_animal: \"Bear\", favorite_direction: North }\n\nAwesome!\nThird Experiment: Calling From Javascript\nIt's also possible to use generated wasm as a library and call the generated code from within Javascript. This has its own set of complications though.\nWebAssembly only supports a limited number of value types:\n\ni32: 32-bit integer\ni64: 64-bit integer\nf32: 32-bit floating point\nf64: 64-bit floating point\n\nNotice how this doesn't include strings or other more satisfying types. That's ok! We can still use a function called Module.cwrap to define the parameters and expected return values of the wasm exported functions.\nWriting this interaction code means that on the Rust side of things we have to treat it as though we're interacting with C. This can make some things a bit complicated, on the bright side it means writing more FFI (foreign function interfaces) later will be much easier.\nSo, let's write a basic function which returns a String from Rust into Javascript.\nuse std::os::raw::c_char;\nuse std::ffi::CString;\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\n\n#[no_mangle]\npub fn get_data() -&gt; *mut c_char {\n    let mut data = HashMap::new();\n    data.insert(\"Alice\", \"send\");\n    data.insert(\"Bob\", \"recieve\");\n    data.insert(\"Carol\", \"intercept\");\n    \n    let descriptions = data.iter()\n        .map(|(p,a)| format!(\"{} likes to {} messages\", p, a))\n        .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;();\n\n    CString::new(descriptions.join(\", \"))\n        .unwrap()\n        .into_raw()\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Deliberately blank.\n}\n\nFirst thing you might notice is that we have a main() function which is blank. This is on purpose, we're going to define that in Javascript! We'll edit the index.html to write a bit of new code for this purpose.\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;script&gt;\n            // This is read and used by `site.js`\n            var Module = {\n                wasmBinaryFile: \"site.wasm\",\n                onRuntimeInitialized: main,\n            };\n            function main() {\n                let get_data = Module.cwrap('get_data', 'string', []);\n                console.log(get_data());\n            }\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;script src=\"site.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nThe final argument of cwrap is an array of argument types, which we don't use in this case.\nIt's also possible to call the function via Module._get_data() but you'll notice that it returns a pointer to a memory location, not a string.\nFourth Experiment: Calling Javascript From Rust\nThere isn't a tremendous amount of writing about this topic, the best resource I was able to find was in the 'Interacting with code' section of the Emscripten documentation.\nThe basic concept is that when emcc goes and does its job it includes a library.js file which we can add functions to via the --js-library flag. These functions can return values, or do things like run alert(\"Blah blah\").\nIn order to do this we need to create a site/utilities.js file containing the following:\n'use strict';\n\nvar library = {\n  get_data: function() {\n    var str = \"Hello from JS.\";\n    alert(str);\n\n    // Not needed for numerics.\n    var len = lengthBytesUTF8(str);\n    var buffer = Module._malloc(len);\n    Module.stringToUTF8(str, buffer, len);\n\n    return buffer;\n  },\n};\n\nmergeInto(LibraryManager.library, library);\n\nThen the HTML:\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;script&gt;\n            // This is read and used by `site.js`\n            var Module = {\n                wasmBinaryFile: \"site.wasm\",\n            };\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;script src=\"site.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nLastly, the Rust code:\n#![feature(link_args)]\n\n#[cfg_attr(target_arch=\"wasm32\", link_args = \"\\\n    --js-library site/utilities.js\\\n\")]\nextern {}\n\nuse std::os::raw::c_char;\nuse std::ffi::CStr;\n\nextern {\n    fn get_data() -&gt; *mut c_char;\n}\n\nfn get_data_safe() -&gt; String {\n    let data = unsafe {\n        CStr::from_ptr(get_data())\n    };\n    data.to_string_lossy()\n        .into_owned()\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let data = get_data_safe();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", data);\n}\n\nIf we build this and load the page we'll get an alert, and see \"Hello from JS\" printed out on the console.\nThe good thing is it works. The bad thing is that it is rather complex to do. Hopefully it will get better in the future.\n\nI'm not entirely happy with this situation, if you have any ideas how we can do this better please let me know!\n\nFifth Experiment: Using The Web Platform\nAs we've discovered by now, the barrier between our compiled code and Javascript is a bit annoying. It'd be quite handy if we could just write everything in Rust and avoid dealing with Javascript except where absolutely needed.\nLuckly for us, there is a crate called rust-webplatform that was started. It allows for convienent DOM manipulation and provides some helpers for doing Javascript. It's still a bit rough around the edges, but the foundations are there.\nTo get started, let's add webplatform = \"*\" to our dependencies. Then we can use some slightly modified sample code from the repo:\nextern crate webplatform;\n\nfn main() {\n    let document = webplatform::init();\n    let body = document.element_query(\"body\")\n        .unwrap();\n    body.html_append(\"\\\n        &lt;h1&gt;This header brought to you by Rust&lt;/h1&gt;\\\n        &lt;button&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt;\\\n    \");\n    \n    let button = document.element_query(\"button\")\n        .unwrap();\n    button.on(\"mouseenter\", move |_| {\n        println!(\"Mouse entered!\");\n        body.html_append(\"&lt;p&gt;Mouse entered!&lt;/p&gt;\");\n    });\n    button.on(\"click\", |_| {\n        println!(\"Clicked!\");\n        webplatform::alert(\"Clicked!\");\n    });\n\n    webplatform::spin();\n}\n\nBuilding our project you should see:\n\nDOM elements created when the wasm is loaded.\nDOM elements being created when your mouse goes over the button.\nAn alert when you click on the button.\n\nDue to the youth of the library there isn't much in the way of examples or documentation, so be prepared to fumble around in the dark. For example, I discovered the key to getting some events and println!() working was to use webplatform::spin().\n\nIf you're looking for something to contribute, this crate would likely be an excellent place to do so! There's a bunch of work to be done and you could really make a difference for the blossoming Rust wasm community!\n\nOutlook\nThe future of Rust on the web is quite bright! Much of the foundations already exist, as we've seen in this article, and the Rust community is actively interested in improving the experience. The Rust repository even has an A-wasm tag for issues! \nThere are currently discussions about moving from emcc to the nascent LLVM wasm backend which you can track here. This may make significant parts of this article obselete, which is very exciting!\nThe ecosystem around wasm in Rust is still young, and now is a great time to get involved and help shape the future!\n\nSpecial thanks to Jan-Erik (Badboy) for his workshop at Rust Belt Rust 2016, his hard work on this ecosystem, his advice while writing this post, for reviewing this before publishing, and most of all for being my valued friend. May we continue to hack in the same circles.\n\n\nThis post was supported by Asquera and is an extension of the wasm chapter in our Three Days of Rust course.

It's been good though. I've relocated, started at PingCAP, found a new apartment, bought furniture(!!!), traveled, travelled more, and been working on a few other bit things.\nMoving back to Victoria from Berlin was (as predicted) quite a change. Having lived here most of my life though, I still have old friends here and know the city well. The city has been changing, some areas are completely full of construction, even minutes outside of downtown. I'm quite interested in seeing where the city is going, and how they tackle problems like homelessness as the city becomes more and more expensive.\n\nMoving here, I had the intention to stay for a few years, so I knew I could put down some roots. I decided to get my flat unfurnished in a brand new building, and it's fun being able to (basically) start over in terms of my designing my living space. It's slow, and logistics around moving large objects are complicated. The journey is sometimes the best part though.\nBeing at PingCAP is really incredible. From day one everyone at the company has been nothing but warm, friendly, and incredibly talented. Sometimes I find myself reviewing my colleagues code, and find myself simply in awe. I've had a chance to meet some of my colleagues in person in Belgium at FOSDEM, and in California at Percona Live. It's very exciting to share food tastes with them. I never knew BBQ'd chili chicken hearts could be so good!\nRaft, TiKV, and the other libraries which our team maintains are engaging to work one. They're all totally open source, so I regularly get to work with outside contributors as well as my colleagues. Open source work is definitely much more fulfilling to me. One thing that's really great is that we're regularly engaged with speaking and conferences, so I get to explore more of the world! It's a lot of work though, and I've been really struggling with imposter syndrome and confidence. I'm starting to settle in though, and it's helping.\nIf you're interested in getting involved with a new Rust open source project, feel free to get in touch with me. I'm sure I could help you find some interesting issues on our projects, and help you tackle them! Even little things like documentation and tests are needed, so everyone can help.\nIn other news, I've been making a concerted effort to be healthier and happier. My time in Europe over the last few years gave me so much knowledge and so many new teachings. I realized when I evaluated myself, I did not meet my own new expectations around the person I was. I've been trying to fix that. I've picked up non-technology based hobbies, taken long trips just to visit good friends and say \"Hi!\", and been doing some fitness training. It's helped improve my perspective on the world and reduce some of my insecurities.\nI'm not entirely sure where life is taking me at this point.

A wayward moth that just happens to be innocently fluttering through the wrong relay at the wrong time.  But some kinds of bugs aren't like that.  Instead, they have risen to superstar status, plaguing veterans and newcomers alike.  But what if these aren't bugs at all?  What if they are actual deficiencies in safety and robustness offered by the C programming language as a consequence of the degree to which guesswork is introduced.  Here we explore a more explicit approach to systems level programming supported by Rust, which we believe will better promote understanding of design intent, and eliminate some of the guesswork.  Guided by a set of classic, but still relevant, bugs identified almost 15 years ago by Engler, we consider this in the context of the new generation of students learning about systems in a typical OS course, where students often first encounter these deficiencies.\n\n1. Introduction\nConcurrency, parallelism, memory management, process scheduling, deadlocks, mutexes, system calls, filesystems, and architectural considerations are all commonly taught concepts in Operating Systems courses. These topics can be a struggle to understand, even for determined students, due to their complex, low-level characteristics.\nInstructors may also find themselves struggling, as these assignments can be difficult to create, and at times nearly impossible to evaluate effectively. Instructors and their markers desire assignments which are simple enough to fit into a few files, demonstrate understanding of failure modes, can be tested effectively in an automated fashion, and show students the caveats of their attempts to solve the problem. In many cases, a trade-off is necessary. For example, building an interactive shell is a common, and much loved, assignment in which instructors must balance the number of features required with the time provided. Features such as pipes, background tasks, tab-completion, and environment variables are all desirable and interesting to implement, but contribute greatly to the complexity of the code, as well as the amount of time it takes to evaluate.\nOn top of the complexity, the ambiguity of language features means that year after year new students hit the same old bugs+++eventually.  Engler et al. (ref) identified a number of problem classes in their work in static analysis that has served as a foundation for many tools in systems (ref), (ref), applications (ref), (ref)  and even compiler extensions derived from hardware specifications (ref).  Students and professionals alike are perplexed by seemingly simple questions such as:\n\nCan routine F fail?\nMust A be paired with B?\nDoes security check Y protect X?\nCan A be done after B?\nDoes lock L protect V?\n\nIn this short paper we demonstrate precisely how Rust addresses these potential bugs in a clear, clean, safe and robust manner. After introducing Rust (Section 2), we discuss how Rust approaches and helps solve to these common bug categories (Section 3). We also discuss the goals of \"Safety\", the state of tooling, and the Rust community (Section 4), before closing with Future Work (Section 5).\n2. Introducing Rust\nRust (ref) is a systems oriented ML-family language supported by Mozilla Research. It was originally conceived by Graydon Hoare and reached its first stable release on May 15, 2015 (ref). It is dual licensed Apache and MIT, fully open source, and governed through an extensive Request For Comment (RFC) process.\nRust offers a robust set of desirable features for systems code: ahead-of-time compilation, zero-cost abstractions, move semantics, guaranteed memory safety, threads without data races, trait-based generics, pattern matching, type inference, minimal runtime (removable, (ref)), no garbage collector or VM necessary, efficient C bindings and robust static analysis\nIt accomplishes these features through a number of novel techniques largely built off its type system and the borrow checker. The Rust community has been working to firmly position Rust as a powerful tool for programming in ultra-large, (ref), embedded, and networking systems.\n2.1 Rust Basics\nTo someone familiar with C/C++ the syntax of Rust will appear reasonably familiar. Rust differs in many ways though, believing in that it is better to be explicit and promote understanding of what is occurring, than to expect the programmer to maintain all of this information in their head and engage in guesswork.\nThis is a key motivating factor behind our proposed adoption of Rust in OS courses, we believe this quality does not do away with conciseness or elegance of code. Community members have developed bindings for well-known tools like Redis (ref) and found the APIs for equivalent Rust and Python actions of relatively similar \"feel\", despite the benefits of Rust's type system providing an additional safety net (ref).\nRust does, however, have significant semantic differences compared to C-like languages. For variable declaration, Rust has the let keyword which is immutable by default, mutability is opt-in via let mut. This opt-in mutability was found by the community to encourage better code. Instead of the programmer needing to remember to use const the compiler informs them of any variables they might have forgotten to make mutable or if it is unnecessarily mutable.\nAs well, function definitions differ from C-like languages. This change makes function definitions easier to comprehend when dealing with complex parameters, generics, and return values. Numerous reasoning for why C's declaration syntax is inadequate were well explained by Rob Pike (ref).\nfn example_simple()\nfn example_params(x: u64, y: &amp;u64, z: &amp;mut u64)\nfn example_returns(x: u64) -&gt; u64\nfn example_generic&lt;U: Read&gt;(reader: U) -&gt; u64\nfn example_generic_alt&lt;U&gt;(reader: U) -&gt; u64\n    where U: Read\n2.2 A Strong Type System\nWhile a dynamic type system is desirable in some areas, particularly in higher level code, things like implicit, possibly lossy data conversions can often be dangerous in system code. In our experience, many operating systems students also struggle with the mental concepts of pointers and their uses. This can lead to taking pointers as values and performing pointer arithmetic.\nThe programmer is not prevented from doing these things in Rust, it only ensures that it is actually the intended action. For many students though, attempting to cast pointers into a value is actually a mistake in their intention. Rust helps users with this by automatically dereferencing pointers when necessary, and providing stronger tools for common places where these mistakes crop up, like string indexing or dynamic array access.\nTypes can be created easily, and there are three basic compound data structures, struct, enum, and tuples. structs and tuples are similar to other languages. Rust's enums are able to represent variants with encapsulated values, generics, and even structs!\n// Structure with generic\nstruct One&lt;T&gt; {\n    foo: usize,\n    bar: T\n}\n// 2-tuple\nstruct Two(usize, usize);\n// Enum\nenum Three {\n    // Plain.\n    Foo,\n    // Variant with Tuple.\n    Bar(usize),\n    // Variant with Struct.\n    Baz { x: u64, y: u64, z: u64, },\n}\n2.3 We Don't Need A null\nCited by its creator (ref) as a 'billion-dollar mistake' null is one of the most dangerous thorns in a programmers toolbox. What's more is that these errors happen at runtime and may take down live systems.\nIn languages like C, C++, and Java a tremendous amount of research and development time has gone into developing products like Coverity (ref) and PVS-Studio (ref) to help discover possible null pointer inconsistencies. Engler et al suggest heuristic methods to determine the 'null state' of a variable throughout the control flow of a program. What if programmers could just stop worrying about null all together?\nMany functional languages like Haskell and F# have the concept of an Option, a concept that Rust shares. Instead of needing to be aware of and check for null at every occurrence, the language semantics require the programmer to explicitly decide on the control flow for all values.\n// Create a `Some(T)` and a None.\nlet maybe_foo = Some(0);\nlet not_foo = None;\n// Unwrapping.\nlet foo = maybe_foo.unwrap();\nlet default = not_foo.unwrap_or(1);\nlet matched = match maybe_foo {\n    Some(x) =&gt; x,\n    None =&gt; -1,\n};\n// Mapping\nlet mapped = maybe_foo.map(|x| x as f64);\n3. Rust: Reducing Bugs through Linguistic Features\nIn Rust, many common bugs can be prevented because: routines with the potential for failure carry it explicitly in their function signature (Section 3.1), RAII is used to ensure allocations are followed by frees (Section 3.2), security checks can be required by the type system or through marker traits for 'tainted' data (Section 3.3), powerful move semantics eliminate use-after-free errors (Section 3.4), and locks inherently protect data, not code (Section 3.4).\n3.1 Results and try!()\nWhen working with traditional languages such as C and C++ it can often be difficult to answer the question \"Can this function fail?\" Checked exceptions can help, but often APIs are inconsistent, and checks for failure can be forgotten (ref). Some static analysis techniques can be used to determine possible missed failure checks, such has detecting invocations that do check for error. Having failure information included in the function's signature and requiring it to be explicitly checked may be a more robust solution over heuristics though.\nThe Result&lt;T, E&gt; enum exists as either Ok(T) or Err(E) and conveys the result of something which may fail with an error. Using Rust's match expression the user can act on various error conditions or success.\nuse std::io;\nuse std::error::Error;\n// Create an error. (Normally raised from lib)\nlet error = io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other,\n    \"I'm an example error!\");\n// The two result variants. Type notations usually\n// not necessary except in small examples.\nlet success: Result&lt;_, io::Error&gt; = Ok(\"Success!\");\nlet failure: Result&lt;&amp;str, _&gt; = Err(error);\n// Return either the value or the error description.\nlet val_or_desc = match success {\n    Ok(val) =&gt; val,\n    Err(ref e)  =&gt; e.description(),\n};\n\nIt is a compiler warning to perform an action such as file.read_to_string(buf) which returns a Result&lt;usize, Error&gt; and to not handle the error in some way. In Rust is it idiomatic for any recoverable error to be passed up the call stack to where it can be sensibly handled. While approaching this idea newcomers typically struggle with the fact that an io::Error and a Utf8Error are different types and cannot be returned in the same Result&lt;T,E&gt;, since the E value would differ and violate Rust's strong typing. This is typically solved by creating a new Error which is an enumeration over the possible underlaying errors as well as any the programmer may wish to include themselves. Then there are the Into&lt;T&gt; and From&lt;T&gt; traits which can be implemented to provide seamless interaction.\npub enum MyError {\n    Io(io::Error),\n    Utf8(Utf8Error)\n}\nimpl From&lt;io::Error&gt; for MyError {\n    fn from(err: io::Error) -&gt; Error {\n        Error::Io(err)\n    }\n}\n// ...\n\nWhen working with functions which may return a Result&lt;T, E&gt; it is common to use the try!() macro. This macro expands to either unwrap the T value inside and assign it, or return the error up the call stack. This helps reduce visual 'noise' and assist in composition.\nfn open_and_read() -&gt; Result&lt;String, MyError&gt; {\n    let mut f = try!(File::open(\"foo.txt\"));\n    let mut s = String::new();\n    let num_read = try!(f.read_to_string(&amp;mut s));\n    Ok(s)\n}\n\nError handling in Rust is explicit, composable, and sane. There are no exceptions, nulls, 'magic numbers' (like -1) or anything that may prevent the programmer from handling the error as they choose to, even if that is to simply .unwrap() it and fail. It's worth noting that even .unwrap()ing does not actually crash the program as normally it unwinds the stack, isolating failure to a single thread and preventing inconsistent state.\n3.2 Borrow and Move: Forget free()\nIn Rust there is the notion of moving, copying, and referencing. In some ways Rust's memory model\nis similar to C/C++'s. It features a powerful pointer system that allows programmers to make fine-grain, informed decisions about how values are stored, passed, and represented. Like C++, Rust makes use of a concept called Resource Acquisition Is Instantiation (RAII). Rust goes a step further, introducing the distinction between immutably borrowing (&amp;), mutably borrowing (&amp;mut), copying (Copy trait), and moving values. At any given time there may be any number of immutable borrows, meanwhile there may only be one mutable borrow, and a value may not be used in the function once it has been moved out.\nThis makes it simple for a programmer to observe a function signature and determine which values the function may mutate or consume, and which it may return. Using this information the compiler is able to determine the lifetime constraints of almost any value without additional notations. In (rare, complex) cases where it does require additional information, the programmer can annotate lifetimes just as they would generic type parameters.\nfn main() {\n    // An owned, growable,\n    // non-copyable string.\n    let mut foo = String::from(\"foo\");\n\n    // Introduce a new scope.\n    {\n        // Reference bar is created.\n        let bar = &amp;foo;\n        // Error, bar is immutable.\n        bar.push('c');\n    } // bar is destroyed.\n\n    // Error, bar does not exist.\n    let baz = bar;\n    // Works, reference mutable.\n    let rad = &amp;mut foo;\n    rad.push('c');\n} // foo is destroyed.\n\nThis behavior is very similar to C++'s RAII facilities and ensures all values are safely destructed in a consistent, predictable manner as soon as they are no longer needed. The programmer does not need to worry about making sure each of their malloc() calls have a corresponding free() or rely on an outside tool (ref) to discover such errors. The borrow checker is also able to determine when a value has been moved into a function call and should not be further used in the caller, eliminating another possible class of errors.\n3.3 Traits: Zero-cost Abstractions\nRust does not use a class based or inheritance based system. Data is stored in structs, primitives, or enums which implement a set of traits that define how it interacts and which functions are available to it. For example, the File is a struct which implements Read and Write among other traits. Other structures like TcpStream and UdpSocket also implement the same Read and Write trait. Traits are zero-cost abstractions that act to encourage common interfaces and capabilities between like-structures (ref).\nstruct Thing {\n    barred: bool,\n}\ntrait Foo {\n    // Implementor must define.\n    fn bar(&amp;mut self);\n    // Default definition.\n    fn do_bar(&amp;mut self) { self.bar() }\n}\nimpl Foo for Thing {\n    fn bar(&amp;mut self) {\n        self.barred = true;\n    }\n}\n\nTraits fit easily together, are widespread in their implementation, and allow for common interfaces between modules to permit better adaptability. Traits can also be used as 'markers' in design patterns like state machines to provide additional compile time verification of correctness.\n3.4 Static Analysis at the Core\nStatic analysis tools, like splint for C (ref) are an invaluable tool for Operating Systems programming, particularly when working on large codebases with multiple programmers.  Rust's type system and region based memory, based on Cyclone (ref), are particularly well suited to static analysis. Indeed, rustc itself performs a tremendous amount of static analysis without the help of external tools. The type system carries all the information necessary for the compiler to understand all possible control flows of the program, all possible (recoverable) errors which arise, and the lifetimes of each region of memory.\nOf particular interest is rustc's \"Borrow Checker\" which analyzes and understands the pointer system and is able to verify data safety, even across multiple threads. The borrow checker is an area of active research (ref).  As a result of the static analysis done by rustc it is able to infer information about (but is not limited to):\n\nUnused results, variables and functions.\nUnreachable code.\nUnsafe pointer sharing (multiple mutable pointers.)\nIncorrect type matching and lossy casts.\nUse-after-free errors.\nUnclear lifetimes (asking for either clarity or refactoring.)\n\n3.5 Threads that don't Bite\nThreading is perhaps one of the most powerful and robust features of Rust. The characteristics detailed above culminate in a sort of tour de force when used bravely in a threaded context.\nHarnessing the power of ownership semantics, the type system, the standard library's threading modules there are a number of tools available (ref):\nChannels provide a way to transfer messages (and ownership) between threads without fear of there being later (unsafe) access to the data by other threads. The default channel provided by the standard library is a Multiple-Producer, Single-Consumer channel.\nuse std::sync::mpsc::{channel, Sender, Receiver};\nlet (send, receive) = channel();\n\nLocks can encapsulate data such that access is only granted if the lock is held. In Rust, you don't lock code, you lock data, and it is safer because of it. Locks are typically represented by Mutexs and shared between threads with an Atomically Reference Counted structure (Arc). It should be noted that this design of locking data prevents a lock from being acquired and never given up, identified as common by Engler (ref).\nuse std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};\nlet data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));\n\nTraits like Sync and Send are implemented on types and symbolize if it can be sent or shared between threads safely. These traits are not just documentation, they are intrinsic to the language.\n// Safe to share between threads.\nuse std::marker::Sync;\n// Safe to transfer between threads.\nuse std::marker::Send;\n\nRust's concurrency primitives are powerful and composable, allowing users to implement other, more fearless forms of concurrency such as sharing stack frames. For example, here's a demonstration of a third-party crate called crossbeam that allows us to safely operate concurrently on stack-allocated data: (ref)\nextern crate crossbeam;\n\nfn main() {\n    let items = [1, 2, 3];\n\n    crossbeam::scope(|scope| {\n        for item in &amp;items {\n            scope.spawn(move || {\n                println!(\"{}\", item);\n            });\n        }\n    });\n}\n\nThis same crate also provides primitives for building lock-free concurrent data structures without the overhead of a garbage collector (ref), again demonstrating Rust's capacity for building safe, efficient, and reusable concurrent components.\n4. Safety, Tools, and Community\nThe concept of \"Safety\" in code is often poorly defined, but can be considered in three categories:\n\nType Safety prevents or discourages type errors, such as treating a float like an int. Rust and languages like Haskell excel here as their type systems are strong, explicit (but often inferred), and do not include the notion of a null that can go anywhere indiscriminately.\nMemory Safety reduces or eliminates the possibility of mistakes like writing a 64 bit value into a 32 bit space (overwriting unintended data), or multi-threaded mutable access to the same memory. Rust's borrow checker effectively eliminates data races in safe code and strong type safety prevents unintended clobbering.\nThread Safety prevents inter-thread race conditions, such as one thread exiting when another thread is waiting on data from it. Rust provides some robust tools for managing thread pools integrated into its type system, however some mistakes are still possible if the programmer works hard enough to accomplish them.\n\nRust advertises both type safety and data safety. There is still research and development to be done before it can truly be considered thread-safe.\n4.1 Tooling\nRust has a robust, opinionated set of tooling. The Rust standard distribution includes rustc (the compiler), cargo (a package manager and build tool), and rustdoc (a documentation generator). Currently there is work being done on a rustfmt which would function the same as Go's venerable gofmt.\nPackage management via cargo is a feature Rust has inherited from several other modern languages. All package dependencies, build options, and tasks are defined in a Cargo.toml file. Dependencies are checked and (if necessary) pulled on cargo build, test, or doc.\nRust supports both unit tests and integration tests by default. Unit tests may appear wherever is appropriate in the code and are annotated by #[test], it is common for designers to include a test module in their code. Integration tests are written in the tests/ directory and allow a package to be tested as a depended upon library. Testing is done by simply invoking cargo test in the project directory. These features blow away barriers which programmers might face in other languages that would prevent them from bothering to test. Additionally, it makes marking Rust based projects very easy, all an instructor needs to do is provide (or replace) the tests/ directory with an appropriate suite.\n#[test]\nfn test_passes() {\n    assert_eq!(true, true);\n}\n#[test]\n#[should_panic]\nfn test_fails() {\n    assert!(true == false);\n}\n\nHaving a standardized, high quality documentation format is invaluable for programmers, and Rust facilitates this. Documentation comments can be placed anywhere in the code using /// for function level documentation or //! for module level documentation. Documentation is in a common markdown format, code samples included in the documentation are automatically processed as unit tests. Generating documentation is done by cargo doc, which generates HTML and manpage documentation. Many Rust projects even go so far as to automate the unit testing and documentation generation step and hook it into their git commits (ref).\n4.2 Community\nOne of the biggest dangers in choosing a language that \"Is not C\" to teach operating systems in is that it can be very difficult for students to get help.  Mozilla's IRC network hosts the popular #rust channel which regularly has over 800 members at any given time. crates.io hosts over 2300 packages. The language reached 1.0 on May 15, 2015 (ref) and has been in development since 2006. The community is active and friendly with a variety special interest groups.\nBest of all, there is active operating system development in Rust. There is a project to develop coreutils (ref), a kernel (ref), operating systems (ref), and embedded system platforms (ref). At the time of writing, these projects are young enough that students could even contribute components upstream.\n5.0 Conclusion and Future Work\nIn this work we have overviewed some of the reasons to consider Rust as the lanugage for a new generation of systems programmers by highlighting precisely how Rust prevents classic bugs.  There is a considerable amount of research remaining regarding Rust's uses in systems code and programming in the large in general. We seek to foster knowledge of the language at the University of Victoria and are working on developing distributed consensus algorithms like Raft (ref) and next generation initialization systems in the spirit of OpenRC.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/understand-over-guesswork/","title":"Understanding Over Guesswork"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/vagrant-clients-for-openwrt-vms/":{"body":"In my last post, we explored how to set up a OpenWRT VM in VirtualBox.\nLet's give it some clients! Since the router is using a intnets we need to configure some machines to use that as their primary way to connect to the internet.\nSince Vagrant has support for multi-machine configurations and gives us minimal builds of machines, we'll use this for our clients.\nThe Plan\n\n        Diagram.\n        \n    \nHere is (roughly) the goal. The pair of VMs test1 and test2 will access test3 (and the internet) through the OpenWRT router we created. Later, we'll build in QoS and talk about the effects of various parameters.\nGetting started with Vagrant\nI'll assume you've already install Vagrant. Let's make a workspace and set some enviroment variables. You might want to change this.\nINTNET=\"openwrt\"\nWORKSPACE=\"workspace\"\nmkdir $WORKSPACE &amp;&amp; \\\ncd $WORKSPACE\n\nNext we'll write a Vagrantfile to orchestrate the boxes and give them various traits.\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\n    config.vm.define :test1 do |box|\n        box.vm.box = \"chef/fedora-20\"\n        box.vm.network \"private_network\",\n            type: \"dhcp\",\n            virtualbox__intnet: \"port1\"\n    end\n    config.vm.define :test2 do |box|\n        box.vm.box = \"chef/fedora-20\"\n        box.vm.network \"private_network\",\n            type: \"dhcp\",\n            virtualbox__intnet: \"port2\"\n    end\n        config.vm.define :test3 do |box|\n        box.vm.box = \"chef/fedora-20\"\n        box.vm.network \"private_network\",\n            type: \"dhcp\",\n            virtualbox__intnet: \"port3\"\n    end\nend\n\nNow you can run it:\nvagrant up\n\nBecause of how we configured the dhcp service on our OpenWRT router, these machine should connect primarily to the OpenWRT router over the NAT (falling back on it if things fail).\nTo check, access the VM's and ensure that the interface enp0s8 exists and has an inet address. For example, if I use vagrant ssh test1, then run the following, my outputs show I am assigned 192.168.1.196 by the OpenWRT router.\nifconfig enp0s8\n# enp0s8: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500\n#     inet 192.168.1.196  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255\n#     inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fe31:dcfe  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20&lt;link&gt;\n#     inet6 fdca:27bb:4407::8a1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x0&lt;global&gt;\n#     inet6 fdca:27bb:4407:0:a00:27ff:fe31:dcfe  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x0&lt;global&gt;\n#     ether 08:00:27:31:dc:fe  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)\n#     RX packets 16  bytes 2584 (2.5 KiB)\n#     RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0\n#     TX packets 29  bytes 3722 (3.6 KiB)\n#     TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0\nroute\n# Kernel IP routing table\n# Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n# default         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 enp0s8\n# default         10.0.2.2        0.0.0.0         UG    1024   0        0 p2p1\n# 10.0.2.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 p2p1\n# link-local      0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1003   0        0 enp0s8\n# 192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 enp0s8\n\nI should be able to access this from another VM if I use vagrant ssh test2 then run:\nping 192.168.1.196\n\nFantastic. This means all of our machines can talk.\nWhat's more, is that these three client machines will all talk to the internet through the router. You can, for example, wget something and watch in ifconfig enp0s8 as the TX and RX change.\nConfiguring a Host\nIn order to configure test3 to be a proper web host for our tests, it needs two things:\n\nA web server.\nSomething (large) to serve.\n\nWhy something large? We'll be using emulated network interfaces that should be blazing fast, so having something large is key.\nThe easiest way to accomplish this is to have a large file on your VM host which is in the $WORKSPACE folder, this can then be shared with test3, which it can serve. This is because Vagrant automatically shares anything in the current directory into the VM's /vagrant folder.\nModify your Vagrantfile to match the following:\n$make_host = &lt;&lt;SCRIPT\n    yum install -y nginx\n    sed -i 's/root .*/root \\\\/vagrant;/' /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n    systemctl enable nginx\n    systemctl start nginx\nSCRIPT\n\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\n    config.vm.define :test1 do |box|\n        box.vm.box = \"chef/fedora-20\"\n        box.vm.network \"private_network\",\n            type: \"dhcp\",\n            virtualbox__intnet: \"port1\"\n    end\n    config.vm.define :test2 do |box|\n        box.vm.box = \"chef/fedora-20\"\n        box.vm.network \"private_network\",\n            type: \"dhcp\",\n            virtualbox__intnet: \"port2\"\n    end\n    config.vm.define :test3 do |box|\n        box.vm.box = \"chef/fedora-20\"\n        box.vm.network \"private_network\",\n            type: \"dhcp\",\n            virtualbox__intnet: \"port3\"\n        box.vm.provision \"shell\", inline: $make_host\n    end\nend\n\nNow you should be able to fetch the IP address of test3 by SSH'ing into the box with vagrant ssh test3 then running ip addr show enp0s8 | grep 192.168. Mine is 192.168.3.201, yours might be different, substitute this where you see $TEST3IP.\nOn your test1 or test2 box, you should be able to do:\ncurl $TEST3IP/Vagrantfile\n\nThe output of this command should be the script we wrote. Your next step should be to find a file of sufficient size. If you're stuck on ideas, there is an hour long video of a Norwegian train trip which would be suitable.\nOn test3:\nyum install -y youtube-dl\nyoutube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7rWhCqsh2I  -o /vagrant/video.mp4\n\nThe resulting file is approximately 1.18GB, which is enough for our use.\nYou can test with:\ncurl $TEST3IP/video.mp4\nQuality of Service\nNow that we have a small network set up with our router, the next step is configuring the quality of service on the router. I discuss this here.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/vagrant-clients-for-openwrt-vms/","title":"Vagrant Clients for OpenWRT VMs"},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/winds-of-change/":{"body":"Unlike most of this blog this post is not technical in the slightest, instead it's a personal update. Though, I have been wanting to write this post for a long time now!\nMany things have happened in the last few months, and life is still swirling all around me. Many things seemed uncertain, other things still do. Irregardless, things are pretty darn cool.\nAnyways, here's what's happened lately.\nThe First Degree\nI went Camosun College in late 2010, and transfered to the University of Victoria in 2012. As of June 2016, I've finished my program and recieved my degree!\nI'm now the proud holder of a Computer Science (Networking) with Distinction degree. I wasn't sure what the 'with Distinction' meant but according to this it means I was in the top 20%! Wild.\n\n        My degree.\n        \n    \nAs the heading suggests, I plan to do more academia in the future. I'd like to work and explore a bit first. Which brings up my next topic!\nA Change of Location\nI'm moving to Berlin, Germany on August 13th! Travelling has been in my plans for years, and Europe is one of the destinations I've wanted to visit most. It's more than that though, I want to see many places and cultures, so choosing any particular one is hard!\nBerlin is an amazing place not only because of how interesting the city and people are, but also because of how central it is to the rest of Europe. As a Canadian, where a flight to another part of the country can be over 6 hours and a busing can take hours out of your day, the threat of a few hours on a train between countries is something I kind of look forward to.\nOver the last months I've had the chance to meet some amazing people in Berlin, too, as well as the surrounding areas. I can't wait to go visit my friend Adolfo in Utrecht, check out the CCC, and meet all sorts of interesting people.\nIt's been a very long adventure trying to get my visa, and it's still not over. Perhaps it is a story for another blog post. Suffice it to say, the process has been incredibly frustrating.\nThere's more for me in Berlin too, including a job...\nBuilding a Career\nI'm very happy to announce that I'll be joining Asquera next month as a Junior Developer!\nAsquera is a back-end consultancy. I originally encountered them through my friend Florian and realized they might be a perfect fit for me. They work with many of the things I'm familiar with, and will introduce me to plenty new things to satisfy my appetite. It's going to be fantastic.\nAsquera does a considerable amount of work in the Rust, Ruby, and Elasticsearch communities. This is very important to me and I'm very excited to get involved on the other side of the planet. I'm temporarily leaving several very awesome communities here back home, and I'm sure that ebing involved there will make me feel more at home.\n&lt;img src=\"asquera.svg\", alt=\"Asquera\"&gt;\nOver the last few weeks I've gotten to know the team a bit, and gosh are they ever cool! I can't wait to work with them. It will be a big change from where I what I currently do for work, and I'm both nervous and excited about it.\nEyes to the Future\nWhen making choices in my life, I try to choose things that will put 'future me' in a better position. These changes are all good, and will all teach me valuable lessons.\nOver the next year I'll be learning about an entirely different culture, learning to learn languages, and broadening my technical abilities. I'm sure there will be many challenges ahead of me, and I'll learn much from suceeding (and occasionally failing, I'm sure) at them.\nIt'll be a wonderful adventure.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/blog/winds-of-change/","title":"Winds of Change"},"https://hoverbear.org/codex/":{"body":"","id":"https://hoverbear.org/codex/","title":"Codex"},"https://hoverbear.org/codex/dev_envs/":{"body":"","id":"https://hoverbear.org/codex/dev_envs/","title":"Environments"},"https://hoverbear.org/codex/dev_envs/windows/":{"body":"Use PowerShell\nTo get to a PowerShell from a command prompt:\npowershell\n\nYou can also hit the Windows (⊞) key and type in \"PowerShell\" to find a PowerShell Prompt.\nI prefer to configure my IDEs to also use PowerShell.

I am currently engaged in a staff Senior Engineer position with Maya Data, with my work focusing on Mayastor. Because of this, my Company and I are not available for hire. I still offer many (free!) services to Indigenous-led efforts, though!\n\nDoing good work is incredibly hard work. The world is constantly weathering your organization with new challenges to overcome, and new opportunities to grasp. I work with your organization over the long term to create capacity and capability amongst your team, preparing them for what is to come. I advocate for practical solutions and foster cooperation over competition.\nPerhaps we can work together to build a better, more hopeful future.\nVision &amp; Focus\n\nBuilding capacity and capability for a more hopeful future.\n\nMy work has two sides:\nThe majority of my time, I work with international technology companies working in the open-source space to build a healthy technical ecosystem and a sustainable future. A healthy ecosystem requires collaboration as well as competition. A healthy company operates as an citizen of the society which has created the need for it to exist. A healthy open source project fulfills the hopes and dreams of the contributors which participate in it.\nWhat time I can mange, I spend supporting and engaging with Indigenous led efforts. This company is founded on unceded Lək̓ʷəŋən territory, and the Indigenous community here has invested in me during my youth. It is my duty to invest back. Creating long term, impactful, healthy investments into Indigenous communities in Canada, as well as globally, is the overriding purpose of this company.\nServices\nAs a consultancy, my company can provide a range of services. I do not produce products, or operate client infrastructure.\nOpen source maintainership\n\nThis service is not available due to a standing employment agreement with Maya Data.\n\nOngoing development and maintenance of a growing open source project is no easy task. The main service I provide is long term, ongoing maintenance services. I can help your open source project reach your goals.\nAs part of this arrangement, I will happily accept deep, hard technical work, examples include: implementing complex topics like Raft's Joint Consensus, adding a WASM plugin architecture to your project, and doing broad scale data model refactors.\nMaintainership is a retainer style service that includes monthly independent-contributor hours as well as full access to all other company services.\nI prefer Rust projects, particularly in the distributed systems, networking, or embedded space. I'm open to other things, particularly Typescript.\nTechnical Copywriting\n\nThis service is has limited availablility (Indigenous organizations only) due to a standing employment agreement with Maya Data.\n\nFrom technical blog article, authoring in depth tutorials, building references, or even maintaining large project websites, I've had a part in it. There are many examples of my writing on on the blog section of this site. I have supported documentation efforts of multiple large projects, such as Vector.\nA couple non-negotiable notes:\n\nI do not write 'benchmarketing'. I'm not going to compare your product to your competitors and show how it is certainly better. I will show a range of scenarios and explain how I ensured the benchmarks were fair, and let you choose not to publish, though.\nIf you publish my work, I reserve the right to post the final (or revised) version on this website. I will always link to your official article. This is to preserve a record of my work, as well as ensure readers who visit my site, but not yours, also see the work we partook in together.\n\nWorkshops &amp; Training\n\nThis service is has limited availablility (Indigenous organizations only) due to a standing employment agreement with Maya Data.\n\nI offer flexible, friendly, casual workshops or for groups of up to 6. Content is custom catered to your needs.\n\nEngineering: Approachable, half day workshops.\n\nDistributed Systems\nObservability\nInfrastructure\nGit &amp; Github\nIntro to Networking (HTTP, TCP, UDP, gRPC)\nStatic site generation\nBenchmarking with Criterion\nObservability in Rust\nRust development\nWASM plugins for Rust\nChaos Testing\nNetworking best practices\n\n\nEngineering Management: One off or regular 1-3 hour Q&amp;A or planning sessions.\n\nRust in production\nRust at scale\nRust over the entire business lifecycle\nHiring Rust engineers\n\n\nIndustry Directions: 1-2 hour whirlwind topical tours. Suitable for executives.\n\nDatabases (OLAP/OLTP)\nServerless/Function-as-as-service\nStorage\nSoftware Foundations\n\n\n\nTechnical review or assessment\nYou can contract me to provide technical assessments of your ideas, your existing projects, or new features. This could be as simple as code review, or as in depth as architecture analysis. \nBusiness advice\nI have broad ranging experience working with international developer communities and been involved with the computing industry over 3 continents. I have previously worked within Canadian, German, Chinese, and American industries. I'm happy to share any knowledge I have gathered, discuss growth internationally, make key business connections, or assess the impact things like a software Foundation might have on your project.\nHiring leads\nI am happy to provide you occasional leads on diverse candidates. I will work with your company to find folks who are a good fit through my interactions with our community. I work with many underrepresented folks within the Rust and distributed systems community.\nThis is not a paid service, and we must have had a pre-existing business relationship in the past.\nPolicies\nI endeavor to be easy to work with. I understand you have your own requirements, and you need things to be correct for any due diligence.\nI have a few policies to be aware of:\n\n\nProvincial and federal guidelines place specific requirements on our business relationship. It is critical to our relationship we respect these guidelines.\nSome key bits include that I:\n\nmust actively sell and market my services in our industry.\nmust provide and fully control all my own hardware, software, etc.\ncan freely reject work.\ncannot benefit from employment programs from your company.\nwork towards identifiable project deliverables. (Such as roadmap milestones.)\nmust maintain several mandates with clients.\ncan freely renegotiate our mandate at each renewal.\nam able to hire staff.\n\nIf you wish to hire me as an employee, you may do so by contacting me personally to ensure you have a foreign payroll entity in Canada which can issue payroll correctly, or use something like Remote.com.\n\n\nOur business relationship must be founded on mutual goodwill and intent. I provide a service to your company, and I will do so as passionately, carefully, and correctly as possible. If I find myself no longer motivated to work with you, or you are not satisfied with the outcomes of my work, we will terminate the contract under good terms and part ways like reasonable people.\n\n\nI am happy to sign limited term Non-Disclosure Agreements. I do not accept unlimited term NDAs, I am not interested in taking on liabilities which cannot be practically enforced, as this risks damaging the enforcability of the rest of our contract. Please choose a reasonable NDA term, and I will be very happy to accept it. If your company does not have an NDA yet, I have one we can use.\n\n\nI bill monthly by invoice. They are expected to be fulfilled within 30 days. Since I have no interest in legal matters, invoices left unpaid after 30 days result in immediate mandate termination, no exceptions.\n\n\nOccasionally, I am blessed with more business than work. New clients may attempt to 'buy-out' an existing contract with me. Your company will have the opportunity to renegotiate our contract whenever:\n\nI take on a new client.\nA new client wants to 'buy-out' an existing contract.\n\n\n\nMandates\nThe company maintains the following mandates:\n\nNone! I work for Maya Data now, and do not accept B2B contracts.\nI don't plan on changing jobs soon. Please don't ask.\n\nPrevious mandates of the company:\n\nVector.dev: Open source maintainership supported by Timber.io.\n\nAdded proof of concept WASM plugins.\nSupported release process over x86, aarch64, and armv7 architectures as well as Linux and Windows.\nAdvised on community chat migration to Discord, helped foster new user community there.\nUndertook architectural and data model RFCs.\n\n\nFerrous Systems: Specialized training module development.\n\nEfforts\nThis company has previously commited time or made financial contributions towards:\n\nThe Natives in Tech Conference 2020, operated by the Natives In Tech community.\n\nContact\nWhen forming relationships with technology companies, I prefer to reach out to companies I think would be a good fit for my services. Of course, you're always welcome to introduce yourself and your organization through consulting+tech@hoverbear.org.\nIndigenous led organization? You can introduce yourself via consulting+indigenous@hoverbear.org. I'd love to learn more about you! I'm interested in finding ways I can effectively support your efforts in a good way.\n","id":"https://hoverbear.org/consulting/","title":"Consulting"}},"docInfo":{"https://hoverbear.org/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://hoverbear.org/about/":{"body":574,"title":0},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/a-ghost-openrc-script/":{"body":90,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/a-journey-into-iterators/":{"body":1298,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/a-new-dawn/":{"body":676,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/a-useful-error-pattern/":{"body":69,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/acm-papers-in-pandoc/":{"body":46,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/an-https-terminator-box/":{"body":230,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/arch-docker-baseimage/":{"body":414,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/arduino-motor-fun/":{"body":324,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/ascend/":{"body":594,"title":1},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/async-auto/":{"body":192,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/back-channel-keycloak-requests/":{"body":284,"title":4},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/benchmarking-is-hard/":{"body":1302,"title":4},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/blog-changeover/":{"body":70,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/capn-proto-in-rust/":{"body":679,"title":5},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/command-execution-in-rust/":{"body":730,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/command-line-args-in-rust/":{"body":292,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/common-safety-pitfalls-found-by-jepsen/":{"body":2645,"title":5},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/deploying-immutant-to-wildfly/":{"body":321,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/docker-archlinux/":{"body":317,"title":4},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/exciting-times/":{"body":104,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/finding-direction-defining-goals/":{"body":576,"title":4},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/first-look-at-dacs/":{"body":1371,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/gathering-our-voices-2013/":{"body":79,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/gathering-our-voices-2014/":{"body":285,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/gathering-our-voices-2015/":{"body":589,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/gathering-our-voices-2016/":{"body":213,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/getting-acquainted-with-mio/":{"body":739,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/getting-the-most-out-of-wsl/":{"body":781,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/heroku-rust-buildpack/":{"body":337,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/init-configuration/":{"body":812,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/init-runlevels-and-targets/":{"body":877,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/integrating-immutant-and-keycloak/":{"body":1099,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/lcis/":{"body":660,"title":4},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/learning-capn-proto-rpc/":{"body":939,"title":4},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/lets-encrypt/":{"body":113,"title":4},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/meetup/":{"body":26,"title":4},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/mtrack/":{"body":102,"title":4},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/new-roots-1/":{"body":743,"title":6},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/new-roots-2/":{"body":1216,"title":5},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/new-roots-3/":{"body":1496,"title":6},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/new-roots-4/":{"body":1225,"title":6},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/new-roots-5/":{"body":2057,"title":7},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/on-c51/":{"body":308,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/openwrt-in-virtualbox/":{"body":654,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/openwrt-qos/":{"body":989,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/option-monads-in-rust/":{"body":849,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/optional-arguments/":{"body":917,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/photoghaphy-last-decade/":{"body":9,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/postgresql-hierarchical-structures/":{"body":696,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-board/":{"body":115,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-motors/":{"body":521,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-orientation/":{"body":720,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-sensors/":{"body":628,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-stabilization/":{"body":926,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/quadcopters-yaw/":{"body":360,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-examples/":{"body":151,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-new-crates/":{"body":435,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-so-far/":{"body":366,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-the-next-generation-3/":{"body":331,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-tooling/":{"body":324,"title":4},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-update-1/":{"body":659,"title":5},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-update-2/":{"body":966,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft-update-3/":{"body":1164,"title":3},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/raft/":{"body":45,"title":2},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/reading-rust-function-signatures/":{"body":1257,"title":4},"https://hoverbear.org/blog/reflections
